## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **A warning when a git command is about to rewind your whole working tree.**
  `git checkout <commit> -- .` reads like "put these files back", but the `.`
  matches every tracked path — so it rewrites the entire tree to that commit and
  silently reverts anything merged since. Because the reversion lands in your own
  working tree, it then shows up inside your own diff looking deliberate. That
  happened here: one such command reverted two already-merged changes, the first
  caught by luck and the second only by a separate check.

  The guard already snapshotted the tree beforehand, so nothing was unrecoverable
  — but its note was the same one it prints for every checkout, and said nothing
  about what had just happened. It now recognises the shape (`checkout`,
  `restore` with a source, `switch`, and `read-tree -u`, applied across a
  directory or the whole tree) and says so plainly: what the command rewrites,
  which repository, that the reversion will look intentional in your diff, and
  the conflict-aware alternatives that fail loudly instead (`merge --squash`,
  `cherry-pick`, `apply --3way`).

  It also gives you a recovery command that works. The obvious one does not:
  after a rewind every tracked file is staged, which is exactly what
  `git stash apply` refuses to merge into — run it and you get conflict markers
  written into the files you were trying to save. The note points at the
  restore-from-snapshot form instead, and says why.

  It warns rather than blocks, deliberately: the command is recoverable, and this
  guard blocks only what its snapshot cannot recover. Everyday discards
  (`git checkout .`, `git checkout -- file`, `git checkout HEAD -- .`) stay
  silent, because a warning that fires on routine work is worth nothing on the
  day it matters.
### Fixed

- **Code-intelligence queue results now survive SQLite lock pressure without
  replaying successful work.** Enqueues and terminal runner outcomes have a
  file-and-directory-fsynced fallback inbox, and terminal events are bound to
  the exact claim generation so stale or conflicting results cannot consume
  newer work. Legacy numeric state is range-checked before SQLite binding, an
  unreadable legacy artifact is quarantined without wedging the queue, temporary
  event files cannot be mistaken for complete state, an exhausted inflight
  generation no longer deletes a newer pending request, and direct queue
  mutations require the claim nonce. Empty index directories no longer queue a
  pointless rebuild. Daily disk hygiene also exits
  non-zero after completing its other cleanup steps when disk remains critical
  or last-resort cache reclaim had to defer, making the unit failure visible;
  the existing reactive disk remediation independently retries every 30 minutes
  and escalates after its configured attempt limit.
- **Captured session output is now redacted before it is stored.** When an
  interactive session exits, Genesis records a tail of the terminal scrollback to
  `~/.genesis/logs/cc_exit_<slot>.log` so a crash can be diagnosed afterwards.
  That tail is raw terminal output, so it passes through the secret scrubber on
  the way in; if the scrubber cannot run, the tail is withheld rather than stored
  unscrubbed. The exit status and crash diagnosis are recorded either way, so the
  log keeps its diagnostic value.
- **Credential detection covers modern key formats.** The shared
  secret-detection patterns expected an unbroken run of letters and digits after a
  vendor prefix, which most current key formats no longer are. Detection now
  handles them, along with several provider prefixes, JWTs, webhook URLs and bot
  tokens. Detection is shape-based and therefore not exhaustive; the labelled and
  `KEY=VALUE` forms remain the broadest net. The reference-capture path keeps a
  deliberately narrower rule, so an ordinary hyphenated name is never stored as
  though it were a credential.
- **Secret scrubbing completes in linear time on every input shape.** Two
  detection patterns backtracked quadratically against long unbroken character
  runs, taking tens of seconds on 40KB of the wrong shape. The rework is
  measured across a matrix of input classes rather than a single benchmark —
  the first attempt was validated on one shape and remained quadratic on
  another — and every cell now completes in under 40ms where the slowest was
  previously tens of seconds. A locked perf-matrix test spans those classes so
  a future pattern edit cannot pass on a flattering input. In practice the
  capture path was already insulated (terminal capture wraps long lines at pane
  width, measured), so this is hardening for any future caller that feeds
  unbroken machine output.
- **Private-key blocks and more vendor key formats are detected.** A pasted or
  displayed PEM private key is now redacted — including one that is only
  partly on screen, since a captured tail starts and ends at arbitrary points
  — along with several additional vendor prefixes, and tokens appearing on
  diff-style `-`/`+` lines are handled the same as anywhere else. Redaction
  around a key marker covers the adjacent key material and stops there, so an
  ordinary diagnostic keeps its surrounding lines. Key material is recognised
  even when the capture decorates every line — a log timestamp, a service
  prefix, a diff marker, an indent — rather than only when it starts at the
  left margin. The scrub subprocess in the
  exit-capture path also gained a wall-clock bound and an input cap, both
  failing toward withholding the tail rather than storing it unscrubbed.
- **A password inside a URL is redacted whatever the URL looks like.** Two
  length limits had been placed on parts of a connection URL to keep scanning
  fast, and each one quietly stopped redacting past its ceiling. Both are gone:
  the scan no longer looks at the part that needed bounding, so it stays linear
  with no length at which a real credential is missed. A URL that carries a
  password and no username — the form some generated connection strings take —
  is now redacted too; nothing else recognises an unlabelled password, so it
  had been stored as-is.
- **Long terminal lines are redacted as one line, not as fragments.** A
  terminal stores a line longer than the window is wide as several rows.
  The capture now reassembles them before scanning, so a value that happens to
  straddle the right edge is treated as the single value it is. And when a
  capture exceeds its byte cap, the newest output is what survives — the cap
  used to keep the oldest scrollback and discard the dying words the log
  exists to record.
- **The scrubber runs on any supported Python.** Its patterns use only
  widely-available regex syntax, so the capture path works with whatever
  `python3` an install provides rather than requiring a recent one — it is
  deliberately not tied to the project virtualenv, which may be unavailable at
  exactly the moment a session is crashing. Scanning cost stays linear in the
  size of the captured text.
- **SECURITY.md described a posture the code left behind two months ago.** The
  security policy told operators to treat the dashboard API as
  "unauthenticated administrative access" and said the dashboard password
  "protects the web UI, not the programmatic API". Neither has been true since
  the API mutation gate landed: with a password set, state-changing `/api`
  requests require a bearer token or an authenticated same-origin cookie with a
  CSRF check, and `/v1` enforces its own bearer. The doc now says so -- along
  with the limits that decide whether you still need network isolation, because
  you do: the gate covers mutations only, reads stay open, it is inert when no
  password is set, and it has a documented kill switch.

  Corrected in the same pass: the autonomy ladder was described as seven levels
  (`L0`-`L6`) when four ship (`L1`-`L4`, the rest deferred), the per-category
  permissions were described as six categories when there are four, and the
  process-group-kill example was attributed to a PreToolUse hook when it is
  runtime library hardening -- a different guarantee, since a hook cannot be
  bypassed by the agent and a helper only protects its own call sites. The
  guard section also named one linter as the enforcement mechanism for shell
  and URL policy; that linter only ever sees file edits, and the shell and web
  guards are separate programs chosen by tool matcher.

  Newly documented rather than corrected: provenance stamping and the two
  privileged-write paths gated on it, the approval requirement and journal now
  standing in front of irreversible entity merges, session-id validation before
  filesystem use, and an External Egress section that says plainly which
  outbound channel actually enforces a gate today and which are only observed.


### Changed

- **A capability can no longer earn standing autonomy just by existing.**
  Genesis's per-capability trust cells can be promoted from "ask me every time"
  to a standing grant once a capability accumulates approved successes. That
  promotion path was scoped by evidence but not by capability: any future
  capability whose cells recorded five approved successes would have been
  offered to you for promotion, and approving it would have converted
  per-action approval into standing authority. The same was true of anything
  money-related: Genesis's own definition calls financial actions
  "never trust-unlockable", but nothing actually stopped a financial capability
  being promoted -- it was held back only by the order of two statements in the
  email path. Promotion now requires passing two fixed bars: the capability must
  be on a short allowlist (email only today) and must not be financial, checked
  both where candidates are proposed and at the state change itself. Everything
  else stays at ask-me-every-time for its whole life -- still learning, still
  tracking evidence, but never converting that into a standing grant without a
  deliberate code change. No behaviour change for ordinary email sends.

- **The session charter now lists every open ledger item, not just the oldest
  six.** The ledger is a curated list of one-line to-dos, and the old window
  meant a session with more than six open items never saw a newly added one in
  its own prompt — it existed only in the aggregate count. The list is now
  effectively unbounded (a 200-row ceiling with an explicit "more than 200 —
  the rest are not listed" note), and an oversized charter block degrades by
  dropping whole sections with a marker rather than cutting mid-bullet, with
  the open/closed count preserved.

- **A review comment on documentation no longer blocks a merge.** The pre-merge
  check already declined to count findings on prose, but its idea of prose was
  narrow: markdown counted only underneath `docs/`, so a comment on a top-level
  guide, or on one of the instruction files that shape how the assistant works,
  was treated as a finding on code and held the merge. Any markdown, reStructured-
  Text or AsciiDoc file now counts as documentation wherever it lives.

  The narrowness was deliberate, and it is being relaxed on one specific ground:
  a separate check, at the moment work is committed rather than merged, classifies
  those instruction files independently and still requires a proper review before
  they can change. So what moves is only whether a reviewer's comment on prose can
  hold up a merge — not whether prose gets reviewed.

  Reversible without another change: `merge_gate.doc_findings` accepts `skip`
  (the default, prose never blocks), `p1_only` (only the highest severity blocks
  on prose), or `score` (prose is treated exactly like code, the previous
  behaviour). Findings are listed in the pre-merge report under every setting —
  the lever decides whether they count, never whether anyone sees them.
## [v3.0b18] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- **Work you agreed to in a session that has since ended no longer goes quiet.**
  A session's ledger is its list of agreements, and it was only ever visible to
  that session — so when a session ended with items still open, they stopped
  being visible to anything. On the install this was built against, 15 items had
  been sitting undisposed, the oldest for 52 days, and not all of them were
  internal development work — some were user-facing requests, which is the class
  most likely to be missed everywhere else.

  An hourly sweep now turns such an item into a follow-up asking what should
  happen to it — done, absorbed into other work, or no longer needed. It only
  fires when BOTH the item has gone untouched for five days AND its session has
  been quiet for five days, so an item you are still working on is never taken
  out of your hands. Disposing of the item closes the follow-up automatically at
  the next sweep. Escalations arrive up to five per hour rather than all at once,
  and they appear in `follow_up_list` and the dashboard follow-ups tab under the
  source `ledger_escalation` — deliberately not in the morning report, since
  ledger text is free-form and has contained credentials.

  They arrive unclassified rather than guessed at: the sweep genuinely cannot
  tell one of your errands from an internal development item, so it asks.

  Tune or disable it with the `ledger_escalation` settings domain (`stale_days`,
  `quiet_days`, `max_per_run`, `priority`), or turn it off entirely with
  `GENESIS_LEDGER_ESCALATION_DISABLED=1`.

- **A `tmux kill-server` with no socket binding now draws an advisory.** tmux
  resolves its target server from the inherited `$TMUX` variable before
  `TMUX_TMPDIR`, so a cleanup aimed at a scratch or probe server can address
  the main server instead and take down every live session on it — including
  the one issuing the command. Clearing `$TMUX` does not help: that only
  re-targets the default socket, which is usually the main server too. A new
  advisory-tier guard flags a `kill-server` carrying no explicit `-S`/`-L`
  binding and points at the one safe form — binding the kill to its own
  socket. Session-scoped kills (`kill-session`) are deliberately not flagged,
  and the advisory never blocks anything.

- **The review-round limit now has an end, not just a speed bump.** The existing
  limit pauses after three rounds in which an independent reviewer keeps finding new
  problems, and asks for a conscious decision to continue — but acknowledging it
  resets the count, so the same three-round cycle can repeat without limit. A change
  could consume fifteen rounds and never be told "enough", only "enough, for now".

  A second count now runs over the whole life of a change, and at seven rounds it
  stops rather than pausing. Two full cycles have already run by then, each of which
  already asked for a decision; something still surfacing new problems after that is
  not converging, and the remaining question — accept what is outstanding and ship
  it, or abandon the branch and start from a design that does not need seven rounds —
  is a judgement call, not one to keep deferring. Both answers require a person, so
  the block says so and neither is available to an unattended session.

  Where the decision is recorded — committing the accepted work — the acceptance is
  spent when used: it clears one commit, once, and re-using it does not buy another
  round. That is the whole difference between a terminal and a fourth repeatable
  escape hatch. The limit also applies when requesting the next review, because the
  local count sleeps through rounds that happen entirely in the cloud, which is
  exactly the shape a long loop takes; that second check keeps no state of its own,
  so there the acknowledgement is required every time rather than being spent once —
  and one acknowledgement covers one request, so a single decision cannot be chained
  into several.

### Fixed

- **Marketing campaign updates now post to their own Telegram topic.** The marketing
  campaign's tick updates previously routed to the shared Morning Reports topic; they
  now go to a dedicated "Marketing" forum topic via a new `marketing` outreach
  category, keeping them separate from the morning report and other digests. Existing
  installs pick up the category automatically on restart (an additive schema
  migration); the morning report and all other topics are unaffected.
- **Proactive memory recall could time out completely.** The embedding provider
  queues standard-rate requests when a model is busy, and that wait can run past
  recall's four-and-a-half-second budget — measured at eight to thirteen seconds
  against a budget of four and a half — so every lookup fails and sessions run with
  no recalled memory at all. Recall now asks for the provider's priority lane, which
  answers in about 650 milliseconds regardless of how long the prompt is.

  **This costs a little more, and the amount is worth knowing: one and a half times
  the standard embedding rate, on recall only.** At one person's usage that is a
  fraction of a cent a month, and declining it means keeping a feature that does not
  work. Storing memories stays on the standard rate — that runs in the background
  with nothing waiting on it. Set `GENESIS_EMBED_PRIORITY_TIER=false` to decline the
  faster lane; recall then falls back to keyword-only search whenever the queue is
  longer than the deadline.

  Scope: this covers the proactive-recall path served by genesis-server. An explicit
  `memory_recall` tool call through a standalone MCP process still uses the standard
  lane, so it can be slow without failing.

  The setting is a yaml lever as well as an environment one, and the template no
  longer overrides it: a fresh install copies `secrets.env.example` to `secrets.env`
  and the environment is read first, so an uncommented assignment in the template
  would have quietly outranked `memory.embed_priority_tier: false` and left the
  documented opt-out doing nothing.

- **The setup script's questions about local inference servers had no effect.** The
  same shadowing applied to the Ollama and LM Studio addresses: the template assigned
  them, a fresh install copied that to its environment, and the environment outranks
  the config file — so the address the interactive setup script asks for was written
  to the config and then ignored, and every call went to localhost regardless. Those
  assignments are now commented out; the values they held were already the defaults.
  The Ollama on/off switch deliberately stays assigned, because unlike the addresses
  its default differs from the template value, and removing it would switch Ollama on
  everywhere.

- **A malformed config section could quietly weaken the private-data scan.** The
  fingerprint harvester, which collects this install's private values so they can be
  blocked from ever reaching a public push, read config sections the same unguarded
  way — and its error handling covers the whole harvest, so one bad section dropped
  not just the addresses it was reading but the timezone and private-repository
  patterns queued behind them, with nothing logged. Sections are now read defensively
  there too. Separately, ignoring a malformed section is no longer silent anywhere: it
  logs which section was discarded and that defaults are in force, because two of
  those settings fail toward spending money and toward running an autonomous job the
  operator had switched off.

- **Model routing ignored the install config, so half the system talked to the
  wrong machine.** Settings like the local inference server's address are resolved
  in one documented order — environment, then the install config file, then a
  built-in default — but the routing layer expanded its placeholders from the
  environment alone. That was invisible while the template forced the same values
  into the environment anyway; removing those assignments so the config file could
  work is what exposed it. An install pointing at a remote inference server ended
  up with its dashboard, health check and embeddings reaching that server while
  routed model calls still went to localhost. Routing now resolves those settings
  the same way everything else does, which also means the setup script's questions
  about local inference finally take effect. An environment variable still wins
  where one is set, and any placeholder without a matching setting behaves exactly
  as before.

- **A quoted "false" in the install config meant true.** Settings written in
  `genesis.yaml` are read as booleans, but a value in quotes arrives as text, and
  any non-empty text counted as on — so `embed_priority_tier: "false"` kept the
  paid lane running, while the same word unquoted, or written in `secrets.env`,
  correctly turned it off. One intention, three places to write it, two answers.
  The same spellings now mean the same thing everywhere, for every on/off setting
  in that file.

- **An override set from the dashboard could never be unset again.** Some settings
  can be given a value in the config file or overridden in the environment, and the
  environment always wins. The settings editor could set those overrides but had no
  way to clear one, so the first time you typed a value there it took over
  permanently — later edits to the config file appeared to do nothing, with no way
  back short of hand-editing the file the editor exists to avoid. Clearing the field
  now removes the override and hands the setting back to the config file. Required
  credentials still cannot be blanked.

- **A config file that was unreadable as settings was ignored in silence.** A
  malformed section already said so; a malformed file did not, even though it still
  contained everything the operator had written — including the switch that keeps
  memory lookups off the paid lane. It now says plainly that the whole file is being
  ignored and where it is.

- **The timezone control could delete the config it exists to repair.** If the
  file was malformed in a way that left its contents unreadable as settings, the
  dropdown rewrote it with the timezone alone — discarding whatever else was in
  there, silently, on the one control documented as the way to recover. It now
  copies the original alongside first, writes the timezone, and says plainly what
  it did and where the copy went.

- **Settings the template ships commented out disappeared from the dashboard.**
  Some defaults are deliberately left commented so the equivalent setting in
  `genesis.yaml` keeps working. The dashboard's editor only recognised
  uncommented lines, so those keys vanished from it and updates were rejected as
  unknown — including several that had been invisible this way for some time.
  They are listed again, simply with no value set.

- **A one-line typo in the install config could silently disable vector memory.**
  Accessors that read a nested setting out of `~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml`
  assumed the section around it was a mapping. Two shapes an ordinary edit produces
  are not: a section whose only child is commented out (which yaml reads as empty
  rather than absent), and a section given a plain value instead of a block. Either
  one raised on the next read, and because the memory subsystem catches everything
  around its own startup, the install would come up reporting a degradation and then
  run with no vector memory at all — from a config file the operator is invited to
  edit by hand. Every such setting — the local inference URLs, the Ollama switch, the
  recall priority lane, the build lane, the models-file synthesis job, and the GitHub
  identity — now falls back to its documented default instead, as does a config file
  whose top level is malformed outright.
- **Two branches that each add a changelog entry no longer collide over it.**
  This file is an append-only list of independent bullets, so two branches
  adding an entry under the same heading are not disagreeing about anything —
  they are inserting at the same position, which git's default merge reports as
  a conflict a human has to resolve by hand. It now merges with git's `union`
  driver, which keeps both sides' lines instead of leaving markers. It makes no
  promise about their ORDER — git's own documentation says union "tends to leave
  the added lines in the resulting file in random order and the user should
  verify the result" — so a merged section may need its entries re-sorted by
  hand. For a list of independent bullets that is proofreading, not breakage.

  Measured before the change, against the repository's own open work: of 49
  open pull requests, 21 could not merge, and **18 of those 21 conflicted on
  this file and nothing else** — every other file in them merged cleanly.
  **Two things it deliberately does not do**, because the measurement above is
  easy to over-read. It does not make a conflicting pull request mergeable on
  GitHub: GitHub ignores a repository's `.gitattributes` in its server-side
  merge, measured against GitHub's own merge engine on two branch pairs built to
  collide on this file, which conflicted both with the attribute present and
  without it. And it does not help a branch's *first* merge, which is the one an
  already-open pull request needs — attributes resolve from the checkout rather
  than from the commits being merged, so on a branch created before this file
  existed the merge that introduces the rule is not governed by it. Measured on
  a real open pull request: the changelog still conflicts.

  What it does buy, stated narrowly: once a branch contains the file — every
  branch cut after this lands, and any older branch after its first merge —
  later merges of the base branch resolve the changelog with no hand-editing.
  Measured in that direction across the same 18: all of them clean, with every
  bullet from both sides intact. The structural fix is one fragment per change
  under `changelog.d/`; this rule does not replace it.

  The rule is scoped to the one file at the repository root, and the tests
  enforce that scope over the complete tracked-file list rather than a sample.
  The leading slash matters: a pattern without one matches the basename at
  every depth, which would silently hand the same driver to any future
  vendored or subproject changelog.

  What `union` cannot express is a **removal**. If one side deletes lines while
  the other edits the same place, it keeps the deleted lines and reports
  success — so pruning an entry, reverting a commit that added one, or cutting
  a release (which moves entries under a version heading rather than adding
  them) can quietly come out wrong, with a zero exit code and nothing visibly
  duplicated to catch the eye. Read the merged file in those three cases.

  Union merges lines, not records, and that reaches insertion-only merges too:
  two entries sharing an identical aligned line — the same closing sentence, the
  same title — can collapse into one, again at exit 0. Measured across the 18
  real colliding pull requests, every bullet from both sides survived intact in
  all 18; the failure needs identical lines and these entries are long
  distinctive prose. So it is a real edge with a measured rate of zero, worth
  knowing when writing a terse or templated entry.

  The attribute also governs `git revert` and `git cherry-pick`
  (`gitattributes(5)`) and, measured here, `git merge-tree` — but only when the
  checkout running them already carries this rule, since attributes resolve from
  the current checkout rather than from the commits being compared. Two
  consequences were measured rather than assumed: reverting an *older* commit
  that added an entry is absorbed, and git then reports "nothing to commit" with
  a non-zero exit, so a caller checking exit status still notices; and the
  guardian's automated `git revert HEAD` on a clean tree is unaffected, because
  there both sides equal the base and the driver never runs.
- **A session slot started after another tmux server no longer gets the wrong
  temp directory.** A new slot created while a tmux server started in some other
  context is already running used to inherit that server's temp directory
  (often the small system `/tmp` Genesis keeps Claude off of). The temp
  directory and the OAuth-durability setting are now pinned to the slot
  explicitly (when a usable temp directory exists at all — if none does, the
  session is left on the system default rather than pointed at a bad path).

- **Two branches can no longer pick the same database-migration number.** Each
  new migration is now named by the UTC time it was written rather than by the
  next free number, so nobody has to check what anyone else took — and two
  people working at once cannot both claim the same one. The numbers already in
  use are frozen exactly as they are; an existing install is unaffected and runs
  nothing again. A migration that has already shipped can no longer be renamed
  or removed either: installs that already ran it would never run its
  replacement, so the two would drift apart with nothing to notice. And a
  migration whose name is subtly wrong — a digit too few, filed in the wrong
  folder — is now reported instead of being quietly skipped, which is what used
  to happen: the file simply never ran, and the change that needed it shipped
  without it.
- **The wrong-repo commit check now says when it did not run.** It works out which
  repository a `git add`/`commit` targets by reading the command text, and when that
  text did not determine a directory — a shell variable, a command substitution, a
  glob — it joined the unexpanded token onto the current path anyway. The result
  cannot exist, so every lookup against it failed and the check was skipped through
  the same branch that means "this repository is not covered". A command it could
  not inspect was therefore indistinguishable from one it deliberately ignored.
  It now reports that the check did not run, on **119 of 2,264 (5.3%)** real
  `add`/`commit` commands. Deliberately an advisory and **not** a new refusal:
  replaying those same 119 through the old behaviour, it blocked **0** of them —
  it was failing open, so nobody has ever been wrongly stopped by this, and making
  it refuse would newly stop 119 ordinary commands to fix a silence.

- **The cold-marketing campaign no longer re-pitches the same person.** Once a
  marketing pitch is delivered to a prospect, that prospect is marked contacted and
  drops out of the campaign's target list — previously nothing recorded the contact,
  so the campaign would have re-pitched every delivered target on each run. Works on
  both the owner-approved and (future) autonomous send paths; a pitch that never
  delivers (dropped, expired, or rejected) leaves the prospect eligible for a later,
  re-worked pitch. (The substrate still ships off by default.)

### Changed

- **Mistral Large is now tracked as a paid provider.** Mistral removed the Large
  model family from free-tier entitlement (unannounced; surfaces as
  `403 tier_not_allowed`). The `mistral-large-free` provider is now flagged
  `free: false`, so its spend is recorded at real rates ($0.5/$1.5 per MTok)
  instead of $0, and call sites marked `never_pays` no longer route to it. The
  provider name keeps its historical `-free` suffix to avoid churning the 30
  chains that reference it. If your account tier still gets Large at $0,
  override `free: true` in your local routing overlay.

### Added

- **Claude Code's auto-updater suppression now re-asserts itself, and "verified"
  means verified.** The two kill switches (`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`/`DISABLE_UPDATES`
  in the user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`) were written only at install time,
  so a machine whose settings drifted stayed silently unprotected until someone
  re-ran setup — twice CC self-updated past the pin that way. One shared owner now
  re-asserts them on every install/bootstrap/update and on a daily container timer
  (`genesis-cc-settings-align.timer`), whose unit goes red rather than staying
  green when it cannot verify. The outcome channel is fail-closed by
  construction: the state starts `unverified` and is promoted to `ok`/`repaired`
  only where a post-operation read confirms both keys are on disk — an audit
  found nine paths that previously reported success without checking (a
  busy lock, a missing library, a write never read back, and callers that
  discarded the outcome entirely), and each now either verifies or says plainly
  that it could not.

  Three follow-ons keep that honesty intact where it was still leaking. A repair
  performed during the early part of a deploy is now recorded even though the
  later check finds nothing left to fix — previously that repair vanished
  entirely, because it happened in a separate process whose result could not
  travel back. A verified-clean run that happens to overlap another run now
  counts as clean, so the next unrelated repair is no longer misreported as "the
  second in a row" and does not raise a false alarm about something repeatedly
  rewriting the settings file. And `uninstall.sh --dry-run` no longer clears the
  saved timer schedules for real: that was the one step in the uninstall that
  ignored dry-run, and it can change whether a missed scheduled run replays
  after a later reinstall.
- **Telegram ping when someone replies to a marketing pitch.** When a real person
  replies to one of Genesis's cold marketing emails, you now get one brief
  Telegram notification — the sender and the first line of their reply.
  Auto-responders (out-of-office / bounces) and spoofed senders are filtered out,
  so you're pinged only for genuine human replies, and never for sends. The reply
  is still recorded on the dashboard exactly as before; this just surfaces it to
  you immediately instead of waiting for you to go look.

- **Gated autonomous cold marketing outreach (inert by default).** Genesis can
  now stage cold marketing emails to an owner-curated prospect list via the new
  `marketing_send` tool. The recipient is resolved in code from a private
  `marketing_prospects` store (by id — the tool never accepts a raw address),
  respects permanent opt-outs, and every send still holds at the email
  authorization gate for your approval. It ships OFF: nothing sends until you set
  the `marketing_outreach` lever to `observe`/`live` (kill switch:
  `GENESIS_MARKETING_OUTREACH_DISABLED=1`). Autonomous cold sending requires BOTH
  affirmatively setting the lever to `live` AND the BULK capability cell earning a
  grant through your approvals — in `observe` (or `off`) every cold send holds for
  your explicit approval even after the cell is granted. Manage prospects and
  opt-outs in the `marketing_prospects` table. Hardened: the `marketing_send`
  actuator is reachable only from the `campaign` session profile (every other
  profile — including the untrusted-inbound `mail`/`community-responder` perimeter
  — denies it, so an injected inbound message can't reach it); arming `live` is
  overlay-file-only and cannot be set through `settings_update` (a model can't
  self-elevate past the observe gate); a held send to a permanently opted-out
  prospect is refused before delivery regardless of how the pitch classified (a
  money-pattern body that lands as FINANCIAL no longer bypasses the bulk-only
  opt-out check); and the `pending_outreach.labeled_surplus` migration no longer
  swallows ALTER errors (a transient lock is retried, a real failure fails loud); and an
  already-approved cold send is halted at delivery if the lever is flipped to `off` / the
  kill switch is set before it goes out (the outer off-switch is now honored deliver-side,
  not only at enqueue — the held send is paused and resumes if you re-enable).

- **Contributor-issue close loop.** When an external contributor's merged PR
  closes a GitHub issue Genesis posted from the Contributor Work-Log (via a
  `Closes #N` keyword), the repo-pulse worker now auto-resolves the originating
  follow-up — so shipped contributor work no longer lingers as a false TODO.
  Scoped to default-branch merges and same-repo references; idempotent, and
  fails closed on any ambiguity (empty/unresolvable state no-ops; a genuine read
  failure fails the run and preserves the cursor to re-cover). Gated by the same
  `repo_pulse` lever. Hardened: the originating follow-up id is resolved to its
  canonical form at proposal time (a prefix/tagged/uppercase handle resolves to
  the full id; an ambiguous or unknown handle is rejected rather than stored as a
  ref the join can never match); and only issues Genesis actually CREATED are
  treated as authoritative close-links — any issue Genesis merely ADOPTED (a
  pre-existing open issue with a coincidental same title, or one re-found after a
  crash) is recorded as adopted and excluded from the join, so a PR closing it never
  falsely resolves a follow-up. (Adopt provenance no longer relies on issue
  authorship, which cannot be trusted on a single-account install.)

- **Contributor issues are labeled by domain and difficulty, enforced at the source.**
  Every issue the Contributor Work-Log proposes must now carry an `area:*` domain
  label (memory/dashboard/runtime/guardian/autonomy/channels/knowledge/eval, or
  `area:other`) and a difficulty/environment label (`good first issue`,
  `first-timers-only`, `needs-genesis-instance`, or `help wanted`) —
  `contributor_issue_propose` rejects a proposal missing either (fail-closed, after
  the privacy scan). The public PR template now prompts for a `Closes #NNN` keyword,
  and CONTRIBUTING documents that a bare `#NNN` won't auto-close the linked issue.

- **Concurrent-session awareness now says what a peer is working on, and which
  model it runs.** When several Claude Code sessions share an install, each one
  is shown a `[Concurrent | …]` line per peer. Those lines previously carried a
  digest of the peer's last few tool calls — so a peer read as
  `Bash grep -n "Version History"`, which says nothing about what it is doing.
  They now carry the peer's model and its topic. The topic is whichever is the
  more recent account of what that session is doing: the summary Genesis
  already writes when it summarises a session's activity, refreshed on a cycle
  of a couple of hours, or the session's own mission, set the moment its
  purpose changes. A mission declared after the last summary wins; otherwise
  the summary does. Sessions whose mission predates this release keep showing
  the summary, because there is no honest way to know when an older mission was
  set. Where neither exists it falls back to the session's newest in-progress
  or open ledger item. All of those are written by Genesis rather
  than by you: the raw first user message is deliberately never used, for the
  same reason the peer's typed prompts are already withheld — another session's
  user text is decontextualised in yours.

- **A session that is working but not being typed into no longer disappears
  from its peers.** Peer lines are hidden once a session's heartbeat is ten
  minutes old, and the heartbeat previously only refreshed when its user typed
  — so a session heads-down on a long task silently vanished from everyone
  else's view exactly while it was busiest. A tool-use refresh now keeps it
  visible. It is throttled to at most one write a minute per session; on every
  other tool call it costs a file stat and the hook's own module load, which is
  a few milliseconds and no database work at all.

- **Outreach total-cessation monitoring, without the old false-alarm trap.**
  Outreach is now in the `subsystem_stale` alert set (WARNING) alongside
  ego/inbox/dashboard. Previously it was excluded because its heartbeat was
  *emergent* — a side-effect of an outreach job succeeding — and the outreach
  scheduler only starts once a messaging channel (Telegram) registers, so a
  Telegram-less install never pulsed and naively adding it would fire a permanent
  unresolvable alert. Two pieces close that trap: (1) a dedicated,
  channel-independent heartbeat daemon (`outreach/heartbeat.py`) that pulses **only
  while the outreach scheduler is actually running** (`is_running`) — so a
  never-started/stopped scheduler goes stale instead of reading a false `alive`; and
  (2) an enable-gate (`_subsystem_enabled('outreach')` = Telegram configured, via the
  same side-effect-free `build_bridge_config` loader onboarding-readiness uses) so a
  dashboard-only install is benign. Documented boundary: a Telegram-configured install
  whose scheduler *never once started* (registration failed) emits no pulse and stays
  a benign `no_heartbeat` — outreach IS a bootstrap-manifest entry (`ok` = scheduler
  *constructed*, not running), so it is explicitly exempted from the started-silent
  `never_started` inference (a constructed-but-not-started scheduler is benign; a genuine
  init *failure* still surfaces); a *wedged-but-alive* loop is job_health's domain. The
  new `subsystem_stale:outreach` id is handled generically by the existing consumers
  (morning-report dedup by prefix, the Sentinel `subsystem_stale:` disposition).

- **Session-start surface for age-stale open PRs.** The repo-pulse worker now
  also caches the open-PR set each boundary, and a SessionStart hook lists the
  ones idle past a threshold (default 7 days) as one passive inline line —
  `[Open PRs] 3 open PRs idle ≥7d — #1379 (12d) · #1223 (12d, dependabot) …`.
  Visibility only: no CI/review state, never "ready to merge", no Telegram, no
  follow-up rows, no auto-merge. Age-based by design (no `reviewDecision`/status
  reducer — those carry no signal for owner PRs that sit at `REVIEW_REQUIRED`
  forever). Levers under the `repo_pulse` settings domain (`open_pr_enabled`,
  `open_pr_stale_days`, `max_open_prs`, `open_pr_resurface_days`,
  `open_pr_max_surface`); `GENESIS_REPO_PULSE_DISABLED` / `enabled: false` stop it.
  Robustness (review round): the fetch now sorts `sort:updated-asc` so a capped
  window (>`max_open_prs` open PRs) keeps the STALEST end — the lane's target —
  instead of gh's newest-first default that would drop aged PRs indefinitely; the
  cache/seen sidecars anchor on `genesis_home()` (honors `GENESIS_HOME`) so a
  relocated install keeps writer + reader in sync; and the hook's
  `GENESIS_REPO_PULSE_DISABLED` gate matches the exact `1` the worker honors (a
  looser truthy set would half-disable the subsystem). `mode: off` / `enabled:
  false` are full-worker stops (all lanes); `open_pr_enabled` is the lane-only knob.
  The surface's freshness TTL now derives from `min_interval_minutes` (2×, 1-day
  floor) so a large debounce (≥1 day) can't expire the cache before the worker is
  allowed to refresh it and silently suppress the surface for the whole window.

- **The Contributor Work-Log can post curated newcomer issues autonomously
  (opt-in).** A new `require_approval: false` lever lets the curator's
  privacy-vetted issues post without a per-item approval prompt — Genesis is the
  gate (the fail-closed privacy scan still runs on every draft, and the row never
  surfaces as an approval request). A cautious-rollout `max_posts_per_day` cap
  limits how many issues post per rolling 24h, so a bad batch surfaces one at a
  time rather than all at once; `mode: off` (or `GENESIS_CONTRIBUTOR_WORKLOG_DISABLED`)
  halts posting — re-checked immediately before each create — and freezes the queue.
  Ships SAFE — `require_approval` defaults true, and it is overlay-file-only (not a
  one-call settings/dashboard toggle), so a fresh install always requires human approval.

- **A per-prompt nudge when a session's memory MCP is running stale code.** Each
  Claude Code session's MCP subprocesses snapshot their code at spawn and never
  reload, so a deploy landing mid-session leaves recall — and its current security
  read-exclusions — on the old code until the session restarts (there is no
  auto-restart). The UserPromptSubmit hook now emits a one-line nudge when this
  session's MCP predates the last successful deploy, reusing the exact
  `commit_identity.is_stale` verdict the dashboard stale-code badge uses (a session
  *ahead* of the deploy, e.g. a manual `git pull`, is never flagged). Throttled per
  session and fail-open: a fresh session stays silent, and any read/parse miss emits
  nothing.

- **Page-top backup-health banner (server-authoritative).** The dashboard now
  surfaces a page-top banner when backups need attention — unconfigured, never run,
  last run failed, timer stopped, overdue, replication incomplete, or an unreadable
  status record — and stays hidden when healthy. The health verdict
  (`{state, code, reason}`) is computed once on the server in
  `routes/backup.py::_backup_health` and added to `/api/genesis/backup/status`; the
  client only renders it. Computing it server-side removes the client-side
  fetch-coordination and clock-skew failure modes entirely, keys "configured" and
  the off-site-incomplete check on current signals (a real `.git` clone, the
  resolved Tier-2 backend) rather than a stale status record, treats a malformed
  status record as unreadable instead of healthy, and does not false-flag a valid
  custom schedule as overdue. The failure reason rendered on the (unauthenticated)
  status route is sanitized to strip home-directory paths.

- **One-click "lobby" terminal door — reattach the whole CC fleet after a client
  reboot.** `generate-ssh-config.sh` now emits a dedicated `Host <host>-lobby`
  block (placed ahead of the numeric-slot wildcard, since ssh takes the first
  matching `RemoteCommand`) that attaches a stable `lobby` tmux session on the
  same socket as the `cc-*` slots and opens straight into the session picker
  (`choose-tree`). One reconnect brings every live session back — they persist in
  tmux on the box, only the client died — pick any slot and jump in (`Ctrl-b s`
  reopens the picker). All emitted blocks are keyed on the stable Tailscale IP
  (not the MagicDNS name), so they keep resolving even when the client's DNS is
  disrupted. `lobby` is not a `cc-N` name, so it never consumes a slot or trips
  the slot cap, and numeric-slot routing through `cc-slot.sh` is unchanged. Pair
  with one Windows Terminal shortcut (`wt.exe ssh <host>-lobby`) for a
  one-double-click return to the whole fleet.

- **Claude Code session exits are recorded.** When a CC session's process exits
  — a clean quit, a crash, or an OS/kill signal — its exit status (with a
  signal-decoded hint) and a tail of the terminal are written to
  `~/.genesis/logs/cc_exit_<slot>.log`, so a session that vanishes is
  diagnosable instead of leaving no trace. Self-rotating; no effect on the
  session lifecycle.

- **cgroup OOM kills are captured.** The temp watchdog now records any new
  out-of-memory kill in the container cgroup (timestamp, memory state, top
  processes) to `~/.genesis/logs/oom_events.log` and alerts once — turning a
  previously invisible cause of vanished processes into a durable signal.
  Degrades to a no-op on hosts without the cgroup-v2 interface.

- **Telegram DM "scroll-up".** Sessions can now read the conversation archive
  on demand: `conversation_history` accepts `chat_id` (scoped to one chat) and
  `before` (page arbitrarily far back, full-length messages), every fresh
  telegram session is told its own chat id, and the session-recovery recap is
  character-budgeted and tail-biased so the END of long replies (option lists,
  conclusions) survives instead of being cut at 300 characters.

- **Firecrawl as an explicit paid escalation backend.**
  `web_fetch(url, backend="firecrawl")` / `web_search(query,
  backend="firecrawl")` reach the Firecrawl cloud API (needs
  `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`) — including from Bash-less background sessions. Never
  part of the automatic chains: it burns credits only when you ask for it.

- **Claude Code login-expiry warning + background fallback.** The interactive
  claude.ai login's refresh token has a fixed lifetime that routine use does
  not extend; Genesis now warns via Telegram days ahead
  (`GENESIS_CC_LOGIN_EXPIRY_WARN_DAYS`, default 5), and — if the operator has
  stored a 1-year `claude setup-token` via `scripts/store_cc_token.sh` —
  background sessions fall back to it when the login is confirmed dead (never
  over a working login).

- **Settings writes are provenance-stamped, and disabling the approval gate
  requires confirmation.** Every settings write records `# set-by: <actor> @
  <time>` in the overlay file so a deliberate operator choice is never
  mistaken for drift, and setting `manual_approval_required: false` now needs
  an explicit confirmation flag and announces itself via Telegram.

- **Opt-in career-outreach monitor (off by default).** A new daily monitor that,
  once enabled, drives a configured external career-agent module to stage
  first-touch outreach drafts into your mail Drafts, then sends you a single
  Telegram nudge to review and send them — it never sends mail itself (you click
  Send). Each auto-run drives the career-agent's OWN accuracy/verification gate
  end-to-end, so a draft is staged only if it passes that gate; a draft that
  can't be verified is skipped, not staged. Ships `off`; flip
  `off → observe → live` in `career_outreach.yaml` (env kill switch:
  `GENESIS_CAREER_OUTREACH_DISABLED=1`). No-ops cleanly on installs that don't
  have a career-agent module configured.

- **cc-tmp blast-radius isolation now converges on its own.** The dedicated,
  size-capped volume that stops a runaway temp write from filling the container
  root — and taking every Claude Code session down with it — used to attach only
  during a guardian redeploy that happened to land while no CC session was live,
  which on a busy install is almost never. A cold-start apply (before the server
  starts) plus a periodic retry timer now keep trying until a quiet moment is
  found, and the infrastructure-posture alert tells "converging" apart from
  "needs attention" so it doesn't nag when it's simply waiting. No action needed;
  a deliberate container restart closes it immediately.

- **GitHub steward now surfaces responses to your upstream contributions.** Beyond
  the flagship-repo deep-poll, the account-activity monitor gained an account-level
  notifications lane: it pings you when someone @mentions you on any repo, or
  responds on an issue/PR you filed on another project's repo (your outbound
  contributions — the flagship deep-poll can't see those). Tunable via the
  `notifications` reason-allowlist in `github_steward.yaml`; respects the same
  `off`/`observe`/`live` lever and pings immediately in `live`.

- **Contributor Work-Log — a curated supply of newcomer-friendly public issues.**
  Genesis can now turn items from its own backlog or a codebase scan into public
  GitHub issues for contributors to pick up — but never on its own say-so. Each
  draft is sanitized server-side (a fail-closed scan of the title, body, *and*
  labels blocks anything that looks like a private address, path, or secret) and
  then held for your per-item approval on the dashboard; batch "approve all"
  deliberately skips these, so every public post is an individual decision. It
  ships in `propose_only` mode: drafts are proposed and approved but never
  actually posted (dry-run) until you flip `mode: live` in a
  `config/contributor_worklog.local.yaml` overlay. Once live, an approved draft
  posts via `gh issue create`, de-duplicated against already-open issues so a
  retry can't double-post. Kill switch: `GENESIS_CONTRIBUTOR_WORKLOG_DISABLED=1`.

- **GitHub activity notifications.** Genesis now watches your active GitHub repos
  every couple of hours and pings you on Telegram when an *external* contributor
  opens their first PR/issue, comments, starts a discussion, or replies on one —
  filtering out your own activity, bots, and CI so you only hear about real
  people. It keys on when things were actually *created*, so an old issue that's
  merely edited or closed never masquerades as new activity; and if a ping can't
  be delivered, it's retried until it lands rather than lost. Off by default on a
  fresh install (it baselines quietly first); enable pings by setting
  `mode: live` in a `config/github_steward.local.yaml` overlay once it has run.
  Kill switch: `GENESIS_GITHUB_STEWARD_DISABLED=1`. A companion campaign
  pre-check (`github_activity_pending`) lets an opt-in digest campaign batch the
  non-urgent activity into a periodic Telegram summary while only spending on
  ticks that actually have new activity — quiet windows spawn nothing.

- **The operations ego stays out of development work.** Genesis's COO ego no
  longer proposes Genesis-development tasks (reviewing pull requests, scoping
  refactors, patch-planning) — those are deterministically moved to the tabled
  lane instead of reaching your approval queue, while genuine operational
  diagnosis (a failing backup, a stuck provider) still flows normally. When you
  later choose to unlock self-development, one config flag
  (`genesis_self_development_enabled`) turns the guardrail off.

- **One proposal queue of 15, not 15 per ego.** The pending-proposal cap now
  counts both egos together, so the approval board can no longer grow to ~30
  items.

- **Stale proposals get premise re-checks.** Older pending proposals were
  invisible to the premise-revalidation cadence (the field was never
  backfilled) and re-validated items stayed flagged as overdue forever; both
  are fixed, so dead proposals stop lingering on the board.

- **Every ego investigation names its deliverable.** Investigation dispatches
  from the operations ego now always carry a concrete output file that
  post-dispatch verification checks, and both dispatch paths tell the session
  exactly where to write it.

- **Real spreadsheets and polished decks from the deliverable builder.** When the
  optional OfficeCLI tool is present, Genesis now produces genuine `.xlsx` files
  (with working formulas and cell formatting) and higher-fidelity `.pptx` decks,
  instead of falling back to CSV or a basic pandoc slide export. It renders,
  screenshots the result to check the layout, and catches broken or stale formulas
  before the file reaches you. The tool is installed automatically during setup;
  if it is unavailable, the builder degrades cleanly to the previous CSV/pandoc path.

- **Stale-code guard for procedure storage after a deploy.** A Claude Code
  session loads its Genesis tools once when it starts and keeps running that
  version until it restarts, so a fix shipped by a deploy stays dormant in an
  already-open session. For the one tool that rewrites a learned procedure by
  similarity match, acting on outdated matching logic could silently overwrite
  the wrong procedure. Genesis now detects that a deploy landed after the session
  started and blocks that tool with a clear "restart this session" message until
  you do. Read tools and append-only writes are unaffected. Tunable via the
  `mcp_staleness_guard` setting (`block` default, `warn`, or `off`).

- **See which Claude Code sessions are running pre-deploy code.** The dashboard
  CC Sessions view now shows a "stale — restart" badge on any live session whose
  loaded tool code is older than the current deploy, so you can tell at a glance
  which sessions to restart to pick up the latest fixes (a session keeps its
  startup code until you restart it). The check compares the session's actual
  loaded commit against the deployed commit and only flags sessions that are
  genuinely BEHIND it — so a session already on the current code, one started
  mid-deploy, or one ahead of the last recorded deploy is never falsely flagged.
  Passive and advisory only; a session with no recorded commit shows nothing
  rather than guessing.

- **First-run setup wizard on the dashboard.** A new install can go from a fresh
  dashboard to a working, connected Genesis without touching a terminal. A
  dismissible Setup card on the Overview tab walks you through setting a dashboard
  password, adding a model or embedding API key — with a live "test this key"
  button that makes a real call so you know it works before saving — and writing
  your identity profile (USER.md), which can now be created straight from the web.
  The card reflects a live **readiness floor** — a genuinely usable Genesis needs
  Claude Code logged in, at least one chat/routing key, and at least one embedding
  key — so it shows honestly what's still missing (including a reminder to run
  `claude login` in a terminal, which the web UI can't do for you) rather than ever
  claiming "done" over an install that can't yet think. A banner also nudges you to
  set a password whenever the dashboard is open without one.

- **Genesis's skills and tools are now portable to other AI coding tools.** A
  new generator writes an auto-maintained inventory of Genesis's skills and
  action tools into `AGENTS.md` — the cross-tool entry point that Cursor,
  Codex, and other agent runtimes read — so Genesis's capability layer travels
  with the repo instead of being locked to one harness. The inventory is
  body-scope only: it lists what Genesis can *do*, and deliberately excludes
  its memory and cognition. Refresh it any time with
  `python scripts/export_agents_md.py`.

- **Memory self-healing is now on by default, and deletes survive outages.**
  Two upgrades complete the memory-repair story: (1) when a memory delete
  can't finish because the vector store is unreachable, the intent is now
  recorded as a durable "tombstone" — the nightly repair job re-attempts the
  delete until it completes, and nothing will rebuild that memory's vector in
  the meantime; (2) repair is now safe against deletes from every Genesis
  process (not just the main server), so the nightly reconcile job runs by
  default (`memory_integrity` mode `active`). Set `mode: passive` in your
  local overlay for detection-only. Recall also stops surfacing "ghost"
  leftovers: results whose backing record was deleted are filtered out of
  vector search and ambient core-facts instead of reappearing until the
  nightly sweep. (This treats any vector without a metadata record as a
  ghost — including pre-metadata-era legacy vectors on long-lived installs;
  those become invisible to semantic recall and are removed by the nightly
  repair with their contents exported first.)

- **Genesis can now repair memory drift automatically (opt-in).** Building on
  the Memory Integrity checks (which detect drift between the memory database
  and the vector store) and the one-time startup cleanup, a nightly repair job
  fixes any drift that reappears: orphaned "ghost" vectors are removed (their
  contents exported to `~/.genesis/output/` first as a safety net), and
  memories that silently lost their vector are re-queued so full semantic
  search is restored. Enable it by setting `memory_integrity` mode to `active`
  (it becomes the default in an upcoming release, once repairs are fully
  serialized against deletes from every Genesis process);
  `GENESIS_MEMORY_INTEGRITY_DISABLED=1` turns the memory-integrity jobs off
  entirely. Every repair run is recorded, so what changed is always auditable.

- **Talk to Genesis by voice to remember things and set reminders.** When
  enabled, you can tell the voice assistant "remember I prefer morning meetings"
  and it stores that for later, or "remind me to call the plumber Thursday at
  9am" and it delivers the reminder to you at that time. Ships off by default —
  turn it on with the `voice_act` setting (or `GENESIS_VOICE_ACT_DISABLED` to
  force it off). Asking the voice assistant about your past and memories is
  unchanged and always available.

- **Genesis now notices when its own memory quietly degrades.** Memory is stored
  across three backends that have to agree; when they silently drift — a memory
  that still exists but has become unfindable by search, or a leftover vector
  with no memory behind it — recall just gets quietly worse, with no error and
  no signal. Genesis now runs two nightly read-only checks: one verifies the
  three stores still agree, the other replays a set of known good recalls and
  watches whether their quality slips over time. If either degrades, it raises a
  standing alert and shows the state on a new Memory Integrity tile in the
  dashboard, instead of the rot staying invisible. Detection-only for now
  (it reports; it does not yet repair), read-only, and off-peak. Controlled by
  the `memory_integrity` setting (`off` / `passive` / `active`, default
  `passive`); the recall check stays quiet until you seed it a few known
  query→memory pairs (`scripts/seed_recall_golden_set.py`).

- **When a background job fails, Genesis now records what actually broke.** The
  scheduled jobs that quietly keep Genesis healthy — pruning, sweeps, harvests,
  reconnaissance — used to log a failure with the details thrown away, leaving a
  blank error behind. They now capture the real exception type and a compact
  traceback, so a recurring internal bug becomes diagnosable instead of
  invisible. The same failures are now surfaced onto Genesis's internal event
  stream, laying the groundwork for it to detect and eventually help fix its own
  bugs — kept deliberately dormant for now (it observes, it does not act).

- **An interrupted request no longer vanishes silently.** If a message you sent
  on Telegram was cut off before Genesis finished answering — a crash, a
  restart, or the session going dark mid-turn — Genesis now notices the
  abandoned session on its next hygiene pass and tells you it was interrupted so
  you can re-send, instead of leaving you waiting on a reply that never comes.
  Configurable via `cc_foreground_reaper` (`off` / `observe` / `notify`, default
  `notify`); observability-only — it never silently re-runs the lost work.

- **Ambient capture now alerts when auto-recovery can't bring a wedged device
  back.** For installs running the optional voice/ambient edge with device
  auto-recovery armed, Genesis now raises a capture-health alert when the device
  has been dark for hours *and* the automatic reboots failed to restore it — the
  one case that means a real fault rather than a device simply being switched off.
  Installs without auto-recovery are unchanged: a merely-absent device still never
  alerts (nothing on the network distinguishes "unplugged" from "crashed", so the
  signal fires only where arming recovery already asserts the device should be up).
  The alert names how long it's been dark and how many reboot attempts failed, with
  no device address or key ever included.

- **When Genesis hands a long task off to run in the background and says "I'll
  report back," it now actually does.** Ask for something heavy from Telegram — a
  deep research run, a long analysis — and Genesis can dispatch it to a background
  session and deliver the finished result straight back into the same
  conversation (your DM or the same forum topic) when it's done, success or
  failure. Previously a background task's successful result went nowhere: it was
  saved to the database but never sent, so a promised "I'll get back to you"
  silently never arrived (the cause behind a research request on 2026-07-20 that
  vanished). Long results arrive as a short summary plus a saved file rather than
  a wall of messages. Failures are reported in the same thread instead of
  disappearing.

- **When Genesis hits a usage/rate limit, your request comes back on its own.**
  Previously, hitting the limit dropped the work — and the message you got even
  claimed "background tasks will resume automatically" when nothing would. Now
  the request is saved the moment the limit is hit, and Genesis automatically
  picks it back up once the limit resets and delivers the answer to the same
  conversation. If capacity keeps being exhausted it backs off and eventually
  tells you it needs a hand rather than retrying forever. (This closes the
  other half of the 2026-07-20 disappearance.)

- **Genesis's tunable cognition knobs now live in one auditable file.** Three
  cognitive parameters — awareness signal weights, depth thresholds, and the
  memory-activation blend — form a closed "learned knob" registry
  (`config/learned_knobs.yaml` documents it; learned values live in
  `~/.genesis/config/learned_knobs.local.yaml`). Every change goes through the
  cognitive ledger (pre-image capture, drift-guarded rollback, visible in the
  dashboard) with hard bounds: ≤5% per step, ≤±20% total from baseline.
  Nothing adjusts autonomously yet — this is the substrate; the evidence-gated
  proposer arrives once calibration data covers these domains.

- **Ego proposals now carry their track record.** When Genesis's ego proposes
  an action, the proposal digest can show how proposals of that type have
  actually fared: a domain with a healthy graded history whose stated
  confidence runs >15 points hot gets a badge ("⚖ stated 0.90 → track record
  0.62 (n=41)"), and a domain with too little graded history gets an explicit
  "escalate — track record not yet trustworthy" note instead of a number.
  Annotation-only by default (`ws2_ledger.arbitration: shadow`); an optional
  `enforce` mode lets the track record drive the digest ordering. A proposal
  is never hidden — annotations inform, the user decides.

- **The `calibration_status` view now includes earn-back evidence.** For any
  autonomy category running below its earned level, the tool surfaces the
  recent graded evidence (windowed successes/corrections + Bayesian posterior)
  so "has it re-earned that level?" is answerable from mechanically graded
  data instead of judgment.

- **Genesis now screens its own skill self-edits for degradation.** When the
  skill-evolution loop rewrites one of Genesis's own skill files, a new Critic
  reads the change and flags the classic self-modification failure modes —
  quietly dropping a safety guard or scope limit, forgetting existing
  capability, over-narrowing the skill to a single case, or gaming its own
  success metric. It runs in shadow first: it records a verdict (surfaced when
  it flags something) without blocking the edit, so the pattern can be watched
  before the screen is ever given veto power. Tunable via the new
  `skill_evolution_gate` setting (`off` | `shadow`) with a
  `GENESIS_SKILL_EVOLUTION_GATE_OFF` kill switch.

- **Genesis can now regression-test a skill edit by actually re-running it.**
  Beyond reading the diff, Genesis can replay a frozen set of real tasks against
  both the old and the new version of a skill and compare how well each does —
  promoting the change only when it shows zero regressions and a real
  improvement. Like the diff screen it starts in shadow: it records a
  `net_positive` / `regression` / `inconclusive` verdict (surfaced when it finds
  a regression) and never blocks or applies an edit. It runs on demand via the
  new `skill_replay_run` tool against a per-skill task suite you author with
  `python -m genesis.eval.skill_golden_set`, and shares the
  `skill_evolution_gate` setting (a new `replay` section) and kill switch.

- **Voice conversations now feed real memory extraction (W0.5).** S2S voice
  conversations used to land in episodic memory as one growing raw blob per
  session close — duplicated on replays, never mined for facts. They now
  land as per-conversation transcripts (CC-transcript format, under
  `~/.genesis/voice-transcripts/`, outside the Claude Code resume picker)
  that the existing memory extraction job mines incrementally like every
  other channel: facts, references, and a topic index instead of raw dumps.
  A new authenticated `POST /v1/voice/conversation` endpoint lets a voice
  edge machine deliver its conversation turns with replay-safe, idempotent
  append semantics (double-fires and cumulative re-sends land exactly once,
  and turns are durable before the endpoint acknowledges). Voice transcripts
  are kept for 1 year (daily prune; an in-progress conversation is never
  touched), and voice conversation rows are excluded from the Claude Code
  session budget and the ego's capability self-model — they are
  conversations, not work sessions.

- **Genesis now keeps an honest, mechanical scorecard of its own confidence.**
  The cognitive ledger's graded predictions roll up into a unified calibration
  table (`calibration_cells`, migration 0069), recomputed after every grading
  pass: per domain/metric/window, how often Genesis said X% and how often it
  was actually right — Brier score, Murphy decomposition (is the miss
  overconfidence or uninformativeness?), and a shrinkage-stabilized track
  record, plus per-tool success base rates. Cold-start honesty is built in:
  cells with thin or no data say "unverified — escalate to the user" and
  never render as a bare percentage, on any surface. Explore it via the new
  `calibration_status` MCP tool, a dashboard **Calibration** tab (with the
  mechanical-vs-LLM grading shares), and Deep/Strategic reflections now read
  their "when you report ~80% you're right ~60%" advisory from this real
  graded record instead of the legacy proto-calibration table.

- **Voice graduation door (W0).** The core now exposes an authenticated
  `POST /v1/voice/graduate` endpoint where a voice edge machine can land
  typed "graduation" events (synthesized claims from ambient/meeting
  capture — never raw transcripts). Events are quarantined verbatim in a
  new `graduation_events` table with idempotent delivery (safe edge
  retries), and nothing consumes them yet — the policy drainer that routes
  them into memory arrives in a later phase. Dispositioned events are
  pruned after 90 days; pending events are never pruned. The memory
  metadata schema also gains dormant provenance/trust columns
  (`provenance_class`, `trust_level`, `attribution`, `origin_ref`,
  `capture_clarity`) for that later phase.

- **A runaway Claude Code temp write can no longer fill the container's root
  disk.** `~/.genesis/cc-tmp` — the scratch space every CC session (and
  genesis-server) writes to — now lives on its own size-capped incus storage
  volume. A runaway temp write fills only that volume; the container root
  filesystem is never touched (a full rootfs would otherwise kill every CC
  session). It also guards the reverse case: unrelated rootfs growth can no
  longer starve cc-tmp below the watchdog's floor. Applied automatically on
  fresh installs (host-setup) and on existing installs (guardian redeploy, when
  no CC session is live so a running session is never disturbed); size defaults
  to 2 GiB, override with `CCTMPVOL_SIZE_GIB`. Requires a block/CoW-backed
  storage pool (lvm/zfs/btrfs/ceph — what the default install uses); a dir-backed
  pool can't enforce the cap on its own device, so it's skipped rather than
  giving a cosmetic guarantee. A new infrastructure-posture check raises a
  standing alert on any container install where cc-tmp is not yet isolated, and
  `scripts/lib/cc_tmp_volume.sh`'s `cc_tmp_volume_remove` reverts it.

- **Autonomy stops grading its own homework.** Genesis's autonomy earn-back
  evidence used to be fed by the LLM classifier's own verdict on each
  interaction — it decided it "succeeded", and that counted toward earning more
  autonomy (a system grading itself). That self-grade feed is removed. In its
  place the mechanical grader feeds earn-back evidence from *actually completed
  vs. actually failed* autonomous tasks, and only a genuine failure counts
  against a category — a task that was merely slow or got cancelled never does.
  Ships in shadow mode by default (it logs what it would record, changes no
  autonomy levels); an operator flips it to live via the new `ws2_ledger`
  setting after watching the real pattern.

- **Those predictions now get graded.** A mechanical grader runs twice daily
  and settles every prediction whose deadline has passed — reading the actual
  outcome straight from the system's own records (did the reply arrive, did the
  task complete, did the job run clean), with zero LLM calls on that path. Each
  prediction gets a real accuracy score, so the system's confidence starts
  being measured against what actually happened instead of never being checked.
  A prediction that references a metric no longer in the code, or whose grader
  hits an error, surfaces as a health alert rather than silently rotting.

- **Every significant action now commits with a falsifiable prediction.**
  Outreach sends, autonomous task claims, build-lane verdicts, and ego
  proposals each write their prediction rows the moment they commit — code
  in the commit path, not discipline. Priors seed from measured base rates
  (a reply prediction starts at the real ~2%, not an optimistic 50%), stated
  confidence threads through where it genuinely exists (task submissions
  gained an optional confidence field), and a failing hook can never block
  or slow the action itself — failures surface as a health alert instead.
  Task completions and failures also now land on the outcome bus in real
  time (the first live emits), instead of waiting for the twice-daily
  harvester.

- **Your decisions now stick.** When you reject a proposal with a reason —
  from Telegram, the dashboard, the chat tab, or in conversation — the ruling
  is captured as a durable **Settled Decision** that the ego sees in every
  future cycle and may not re-propose, re-litigate, or work around. Repeat
  rulings on the same theme reaffirm the existing decision instead of piling
  up duplicates; only you can supersede one. Previously each entry point
  recorded a different subset of side effects (the dashboard recorded almost
  nothing), so the ego could agree with you in chat and then re-propose the
  same thing days later. A new `ego_decision` tool also captures rulings you
  state directly in conversation.

- **Your deny reasons finally count as engagement.** The engagement signal
  now covers all Genesis outbound — outreach messages *and* ego proposals —
  and a typed reason on a proposal counts as engagement. The system will no
  longer claim "the user doesn't engage" while you're actively ruling on its
  proposals. The dashboard reject flow nudges for a reason ("Why? This
  teaches the ego — a reason becomes a standing rule"), which stays optional.

- **Groundwork: Genesis can now measure whether its entity graph would improve
  recall, without changing any results yet.** A new shadow-only lane resolves a
  recall query to entities in its knowledge graph, walks their relationships,
  and records how many new, still-valid memories it would have surfaced that
  ordinary search missed. This is measurement only (one internal metric per
  recall); it ships off by default and never alters what recall returns, so the
  data can decide whether building the live version is worth it.

- **Genesis now tidies near-duplicate entities in its knowledge graph.** When
  it learns about a "thing" (a project, tool, concept, person) whose name is
  very close to one it already knows, it now decides whether they are the same
  thing or genuinely different, and can merge the duplicates so its memory of
  you stays coherent instead of fragmenting across "neural monitor" /
  "neural-monitor" / "neural_monitor". Two independent models must agree before
  anything merges, and pairs that only differ by a number (`PR #989` vs
  `PR #990`) are never merged. It ships in **shadow mode by default** — it
  records what it *would* merge without touching anything, so you can review the
  proposals first; flip it to live with
  `settings_update("entity_adjudication", {"mode": "live"})` (or turn it off
  entirely). A background sweep also reconciles the entities it already had.

- **Genesis now watches whether the host machine's clock is actually being
  kept in sync.** The container shares its host's clock, so if the host's
  time-sync daemon dies or stops syncing, TLS handshakes, log timestamps, and
  scheduled jobs all quietly skew — and nothing noticed. The infrastructure
  profile's host plane now reports which NTP daemon runs the clock and a
  composite health state (synced / degraded / unsynced) that catches a dead
  daemon even while the kernel's own sync flag still claims all is well; a
  state flip surfaces as an infrastructure-drift observation like any other
  change to the machine's vitals.

- **Genesis now writes down its predictions before acting — the substrate.**
  A new cognitive ledger stores falsifiable predictions ("this outreach will
  get a reply within 72 hours, confidence 0.02") behind a hard validation
  gate: a prediction that doesn't name a registered, mechanically-checkable
  metric with a deadline literally cannot be written. Nine starter metrics
  ship with their grading rules implemented and tested (replies, task
  completion, clean job days, build greenlights, ego-proposal execution).
  This is the foundation; the hooks that write predictions on every action
  and the grader that scores them land next.

- **An unprotected box now tells you.** If a crash-resilience protection is
  missing on your install — container swap disabled, systemd-oomd
  pressure-kill not configured, no host swap, the container's swap allowance
  switched off, or (on a systemd-networkd–managed box) the network
  address-retention or the self-healing networkd watchdog missing — Genesis
  now raises a standing alert (dashboard + morning report) naming what's
  missing and how to fix it, and clears it automatically once the protection
  is restored. The network checks stay silent on NetworkManager installs,
  where they don't apply. Previously a box that was *always* unprotected
  produced no signal at all; only a *change* was detected. If the
  infrastructure self-profile stops refreshing (>3 days old), you get a
  distinct "posture unknown" alert instead of stale claims.

- **Genesis can now take a hypervisor backup of its own host VM — and grows
  finally get their safety net.** The provisioning gate has always wanted a
  recent backup before an irreversible grow, but nothing could take one, so
  the check sat disabled. Now a stale backup turns a grow proposal into a
  backup→verify→grow chain under one clearly-worded approval: the backup
  starts immediately (vzdump, on a third API token that can back up but never
  resize), verification runs in the background for however long the dump
  takes, old backups rotate away automatically (keep-last, configurable), and
  the grow executes only after the backup verifies and a fresh safety
  re-check passes. Backups can also be taken on demand (`provision_vzdump`),
  have their own weekly budget separate from grows (note: the existing
  `max_actions_per_week` cap now counts grows only), and an interrupted
  verification resumes after a restart with no state lost. Restore is
  deliberately not included — that is a destructive operation with its own
  upcoming review.

- **The guardian now keeps container swap enabled on its own.** Swap is what
  turns a memory spike into graceful slowdown instead of a machine-wedging
  thrash, but the setting only got applied when host setup ran — an install
  that just pulls code updates could sit unprotected indefinitely (observed
  live: a second install ran for weeks one memory spike away from the wedge).
  The guardian now re-checks the setting every tick and repairs both halves
  when drifted: the persistent config (so future restarts have it) and the
  live cgroup (so protection is immediate, no restart needed). Repairs page an
  INFO note; a repair that can't complete pages a warning at most daily. Hosts
  where swap-off is deliberate can opt out (`swap_reconcile_enabled: false`).

- **The dashboard has a Sessions cockpit.** A new Sessions tab shows every
  CC session next to what it's actually FOR: the immutable origin prompt it
  was born from, its living mission, the full TODO-ledger with status and
  evidence, a compaction-waypoint timeline, and the repo-pulse panel —
  "looks shipped by PR #N" proposals you can confirm (closes the item with
  the PR as evidence) or reject with one click. The overview card's
  quick-glance modal stays and links through to the full cockpit.

- **Your session TODO ledger now notices when a merged PR ships an item.** N
  parallel sessions each carry open ledger rows, and until now closing them
  meant remembering to do it by hand — work shipped in one session left stale
  "open" items in another. At session boundaries Genesis now checks recently
  merged PRs against every open ledger item: a PR that explicitly cites
  `Ledger: <item-id>` in its body closes the item automatically (with the PR
  recorded as evidence, and reversible); anything less certain — a bare id
  mention, or an AI-judged title/description match — becomes a small
  "looks shipped by PR #N — confirm or ignore" note in the session's charter
  block, never a silent close. Levers: settings domain `repo_pulse`
  (off / propose_only / live) and the `GENESIS_REPO_PULSE_DISABLED=1` kill
  switch.

- **Genesis now remembers how its background jobs actually ran, not just a
  running tally.** Until now each scheduled job kept only a single cumulative
  row, so a job that failed for a week and then recovered looked identical to
  one that never failed — the history was gone. Genesis now keeps a per-run
  record (with real durations where a job marks its own start), so a bad patch
  or an intermittent outage leaves a visible trace instead of vanishing into an
  average. It stays cheap on purpose: a healthy or a stuck high-frequency job is
  recorded at most hourly, so the log captures every distinct episode without
  drowning in routine ticks.

- **Alert history survives a restart.** The list of what's currently wrong used
  to live only in memory and reset every time Genesis restarted, so an incident
  that opened and closed while you weren't looking left no record. Alerts are now
  written to a durable incident log — each one opened when it starts firing and
  stamped resolved when it clears — so you can see what happened overnight, not
  just what's broken right now.

- **Genesis notices when it stops learning about you.** The stream that updates
  Genesis's model of you from its own reflections had gone quiet for months with
  nothing flagging it. Genesis now watches that stream and raises a (non-paging)
  alert if it goes silent for more than two weeks, and clears it automatically
  once fresh learning resumes.

- **Data backfills now heal themselves on update.** Some upgrades need more than
  a schema change — they need existing data reshaped (e.g. tagging every stored
  memory's vector with its provenance class). Those backfills used to be
  one-off scripts each install had to remember to run by hand, so an install
  that skipped one silently drifted. Genesis now runs them automatically in the
  background after startup, tracked in a ledger so each runs exactly once, never
  blocks boot, and simply no-ops on an install that's already current — so a
  lagging clone catches up on its next update with nothing to run manually. The
  first one backfills provenance onto older memory vectors.

- **Legacy memories join the wing system.** ~2.9K memories stored before
  wing classification existed (most predating the user-work wings added in
  May) sat in `general/uncategorized`, invisible to wing-filtered recall.
  A new one-shot supervised backfill (`scripts/wing_backfill.py`) classifies
  them in two stages — the deterministic taxonomy layers first, then an LLM
  batch pass through a new `wing_backfill` routing call site for the rows
  keywords can't reach — and writes wing/room/life-domain to both SQLite
  metadata and the Qdrant payload (with revert-on-failure so the stores never
  diverge), making them reachable by wing-filtered recall. Dry-run by default;
  the bulk write is gated on a human-reviewed sample.

- **Genesis survives — and now auto-recovers from — a wedged network.** Under
  heavy memory pressure the container's networking daemon can hit kernel
  timeouts, drop its DHCP lease, and take the machine off the network until
  someone restarts the daemon by hand. Fresh and updated installs now (1) pin
  the address so a networking failure keeps the connection instead of dropping
  it, and (2) run a lightweight watchdog that detects a wedged/inactive
  networking daemon and restarts it automatically (address-preserving, so no
  blip). Heal events are recorded and surfaced in the infrastructure profile,
  so a recurring fault is visible instead of silent. Networking runs a
  different manager (e.g. NetworkManager) or lacks sudo? It skips cleanly.
  See `docs/reference/network-resilience.md`.

- **Genesis now notices when merged code isn't actually deployed.** Pulling
  changes with a bare `git merge` between updates loads the new code on
  restart but silently skips everything only `update.sh` activates — new
  systemd units, the host guardian redeploy, tool pins. One install ran six
  days like that with a shipped timer never installed and zero signal
  anywhere. The health snapshot now has a `deploy_health` section (days since
  the last update, commits behind, missing units, host-guardian drift — no
  network calls), and the awareness loop raises a dashboard alert on any
  drift, escalating to a Telegram page only when it's sustained (a week stale
  and 20+ commits behind, or a missing unit ignored for a day). The fix is
  always the same and the alert says so: run `scripts/update.sh`.

- **Recall now follows memory links — the benchmark-proven +12.6pp mechanism
  lands in production, shadow-first.** LongMemEval showed that appending
  1-hop linked neighbors to recalled results lifts answer accuracy from 64.8%
  to 77.4% (temporal reasoning +23pp, multi-session +17pp), but that expansion
  only existed in the eval harness. It's now wired into every MCP recall
  surface (full, compact previews, proactive injection), shipping in `shadow`
  mode: expansion is computed and measured (`eval_events`) without changing
  any output until the `memory_recall` settings domain flips
  `graph_expansion.mode` to `live` — no restart needed, and `off` is the
  instant kill switch. Expanded neighbors carry their stored provenance and
  pass the exact same injection defenses (wrap/count/drop) as organic
  results; `contradicts` links are never followed, and neighbors are flagged
  `via_graph` so callers can weigh them. The benchmark harness now calls this
  same production primitive, so future eval numbers measure shipped code.

- **A resumed conversation can no longer run twice at once.** If an SSH drop
  leaves a Claude Code session executing headless and you resume that same
  conversation elsewhere, both processes used to write to the same transcript
  and the same files simultaneously (Claude Code itself raises no warning).
  Now Genesis tracks which process owns each conversation: the newer session
  wins, the orphan's file-changing tools are blocked with instructions, the
  resuming session is told about the orphan at startup, and you get paged on
  Telegram within minutes. Intentional dual-sessions have a documented
  override. Bootstrap also hardens the root cause: sshd detects dead SSH
  clients in ~60s (instead of hours), and interactive `claude` launches are
  wrapped in a uniquely-named tmux session so a dropped connection leaves a
  reattachable session instead of an orphan (opt out:
  `GENESIS_NO_TMUX_WRAP=1`).

- **Genesis now notices the agreements a session forgot to write down — in
  shadow.** At every compaction boundary a detached worker re-reads the
  conversation since the last checkpoint and proposes missed "yes, do that"
  moments and direction pivots as session-ledger candidates. Proposals are
  only LOGGED for now (the live ledger is never touched): each one carries a
  verbatim quote that is deterministically checked against the transcript,
  and a precision report compares proposals against what was actually
  captured by hand — the safety net earns write access with data before it
  gets it. Levers: the `session_ledger_shadow` settings domain (off/shadow)
  and a `GENESIS_LEDGER_SHADOW_DISABLED=1` kill switch; a `--backfill` mode
  replays past sessions for tuning. Also fixes a charter bug where a session
  whose first message was a bare slash command (like `/compact`) could have
  recorded that command as its permanent origin.

- **Benchmark runs can now select exactly the arms they pay for.** The
  LongMemEval harness gained `--arms` (comma-separated labels, e.g.
  `--graph --arms raw,raw+graph`), so a paired baseline-vs-graph comparison
  no longer forces the full four-arm spend. Unknown labels fail fast with
  the selectable universe listed — a paid run never silently widens.

- **A memory spike now degrades gracefully instead of wedging the machine.**
  On systems that ran out of memory with no swap and no userspace OOM killer,
  one greedy process could drag the whole box into unrecoverable thrash —
  load in the hundreds, SSH dead, everything down together. Installs now set
  up systemd-oomd with pressure-percentage kill policies (adaptive to any
  machine size, applied automatically on bootstrap and on your next update,
  skipped cleanly where systemd/oomd/PSI aren't available), the Genesis
  server marks itself `avoid` so the greedy session tree dies first, managed
  container installs get swap enabled (`limits.memory.swap`), and setup warns
  with exact remediation when swap is missing or disabled. The infrastructure
  profile records the swap/oomd state as facts, so an unprotected install is
  flagged in `INFRASTRUCTURE.md`. Runbook: `docs/reference/memory-resilience.md`.

- **The CC Sessions card now tells the truth, and clicking it shows why.**
  The dashboard card used to show a DB-side "active" count that routinely
  disagreed with the processes actually running, plus a bare "3/20" that
  looked like a session count but was really the hourly rate budget. The card
  now shows both counts side by side ("N live / M db", amber when they
  diverge), labels the budget as a budget, and opens a per-session modal:
  every session from the last 24 hours with its live process (slot, pid,
  memory), its charter (mission, compactions, open ledger items), and
  explicit badges wherever the database and reality disagree — including
  live processes with no session row at all.

- **Sessions now keep a durable TODO ledger that survives compaction.** An
  agreement made mid-session ("yes, do that") used to live only in
  conversation — one compaction summary could quietly drop it. Sessions can
  now record agreements as ledger items the moment they happen; open items
  re-inject into every post-compaction window (with a per-turn
  `[Charter: … | open: N]` tag showing drift at a glance) until they're
  closed as done, absorbed elsewhere, or consciously dropped. Charters — the
  session's origin, a living mission line, and pointers to its governing
  docs — moved from per-session JSON files into the database so all of this
  is queryable; the human-readable `charter.md` mirror stays.

- **The memory benchmark can now measure whether Genesis's memory graph
  actually helps.** A new `--graph` mode runs every benchmark arm twice — once
  against a plain store and once against a store where memories link to
  similar earlier memories exactly as they do in production — and follows
  those links at recall time to pull in related memories the search itself
  missed. Baseline and graph runs use fully separate stores, so the
  comparison is honest (links can't quietly tint the baseline's ranking). Per
  question, the results record how many links formed and how much extra gold
  evidence the graph surfaced, and a graph run that formed no links says so
  loudly instead of silently matching its baseline. The memory linker's
  similarity threshold is also now configurable per instance instead of fixed.

- **The memory benchmark now grades temporal questions fairly and explains
  its misses.** The LongMemEval reader gets the question's date (the
  benchmark's own convention — without it, "how many weeks ago…" questions
  were unanswerable by construction), so temporal scores now measure memory,
  not a missing calendar. New `--dump-dir` writes per-question diagnostics
  (query, recalled memories, answer, verdict) for failure analysis, a new
  evidence-coverage metric shows *how much* of the gold evidence was
  retrieved (not just whether any was), and `--types` runs a single question
  category — so a targeted slice no longer costs a full 500-question run.

- **Claude Code sessions no longer forget what they were started for.** Long
  sessions compact their context many times, and each summary is biased toward
  recent work — after enough compactions a session can no longer connect
  "what's next" to its original goal. Now the first compaction snapshots the
  session's charter (the verbatim opening prompt) to disk, and every later
  window gets it re-injected automatically. The origin survives any number of
  compactions; `/clear` still means a genuinely fresh start. Charters live in
  `~/.genesis/sessions/<session-id>/charter.md`.

- **Provenance-based content isolation is now enforce-ready (running in
  observe-only mode).** Genesis already tags where every memory came from —
  its own thinking, your messages, or the outside world (a webpage, an
  ingested doc, an email). This work makes that tag follow the content all the
  way through recall, so Genesis can tell, at the moment content is about to
  enter a prompt, whether it is quoted outside material rather than a trusted
  instruction. The stored tag decides everywhere: outside material that landed
  in Genesis's own session memory (not just the knowledge base) is delimited
  and labeled external on every recall surface — proactive hints, voice
  responses, and the dashboard memory browser included — instead of reading as
  first-party memory. The protection is armed but watching, not acting: it records
  what it *would* block so the behavior can be verified against real traffic
  before it's switched on. When switched on (a live setting, instantly
  reversible), outside-world content is held back only from automatic,
  uninvited context in unsupervised background sessions — your explicit
  searches and everything in a normal foreground conversation keep working
  exactly as before. Held back means fully out of the loop: a blocked item
  also earns no retrieval credit, so it can't quietly climb the memory
  ranking through the very sessions that refuse it. If the guard ever fights
  legitimate activity, it stands itself down and pages you.

- **Genesis now notices when memories quietly lose semantic search.** When an
  embedding permanently fails, that memory becomes keyword-only — findable by
  exact words but invisible to meaning-based recall — and nothing flagged the
  pile building up (the existing alert only caught embeddings failing *right
  now*, not the backlog left behind). A new hourly check counts these
  permanently-stuck memories: a modest pile shows on the dashboard, and a large
  one (a real chunk of the store gone semantically dark) pages you on Telegram.
  It clears itself once the memories are re-embedded.

- **The recovery brain no longer drifts behind a version bump.** A nightly
  job re-aligns the host's Claude Code and Node.js to the pinned versions.
  Previously this happened only when you ran an update, so a pin bump could
  leave the host's autonomous-recovery Claude Code lagging for days. It heals
  only real drift, is a clean no-op when everything is already aligned, and a
  failed alignment now shows up as a failed timer instead of going quiet.

- **Genesis notices if systemd "linger" gets turned off.** Linger is what
  keeps Genesis's background services alive after you log out — if it is ever
  disabled, everything dies silently at the next logout. A new health check
  watches both the host and the container and raises a single alert (with the
  exact re-enable command) when linger is off, before the next logout can bite.

- **Code quality is now a measured series, not a feeling.** A new
  `dev_quality` dimension in the weekly eval snapshots tracks review
  findings per merged PR (by severity, harvested from the PR bots' inline
  comments every Sunday), open code-audit findings, and the edit-failure
  rate — so "the codebase is getting better" is a falsifiable trend on the
  dashboard, honest about small numbers (rates go null, not zero, when
  there's no data).

- **Editing a file now surfaces that subsystem's traps.** The first time a
  session touches each subsystem, its do-not-touch edges and easy-to-forget
  mechanisms from the architecture map are injected right at the edit — the
  invariants arrive while the code is being written instead of at review
  time.

- **The idle-time code auditor got a sharper brief.** Its instructions now
  use a four-class failure taxonomy tuned to AI-generated code (structural,
  async/state, error-handling, tests), it picks targets from real
  import-graph data (highest fan-in modules first), and findings carry a
  category. Also fixes a long-standing bug where the auditor could never
  report a critical-severity finding — its output schema simply didn't
  include the word.

- **Every memory now carries a provenance class — and immunity gets its kill
  switch before it gets its gates.** Everything Genesis stores is stamped
  `owner`, `first_party`, or `external_untrusted` at write time (your words /
  Genesis's own observations / content pulled off the world, including
  ingested documents), with all existing memories backfilled. This is the
  foundation for the WS-3 immunity gates: crafted external content becomes
  blockable from turning into procedures, identity edits, or autonomy
  evidence by *origin*, not content guessing. The control surface ships
  first: a live-editable `ws3_immunity` settings domain (master switch +
  per-gate off/shadow/enforce) that takes effect instantly with no restart —
  and owner/first-party content can never be blocked in any mode, by
  construction. No gates are active yet; they arrive in the next phase, in
  observe-only shadow mode.

- **Code reviews follow a written protocol instead of convention.** The
  architect reviewer now opens with a scope-drift check (did the change do
  what was asked — nothing more, nothing less), grades findings on an
  explicit BLOCKER / SHOULD-FIX / NOTE ladder, must quote the exact line
  motivating each finding or have the finding's confidence capped, consults
  prior review learnings before starting, and closes with an explicit
  completion status. Adapted from the gstack review framework.

- **The host Guardian now tells you before its AI recovery brain loses its
  login — and can survive it without you touching the host.** The Guardian's
  autonomous diagnosis runs on Claude Code authenticated by a one-time login at
  install, which never refreshes; if it died, the brain silently went dark and
  you'd only find out mid-incident. Genesis now watches that login's health and
  alerts you (over Telegram) if it goes dead, and warns ~30 days before a
  fallback token would expire. Optionally, mint a one-year token with `claude
  setup-token` from any machine and pipe it to `scripts/store_cc_token.sh` —
  Genesis syncs it to the host and uses it **only** as a fallback when the
  host's own login is dead, never overriding a working login. The token is a
  subscription token (not an API key), is stored 0600 and never logged, and the
  health signal sends only status booleans — never the token or your account
  details. You can set this up at install or just wait for the first alert.

- **`genesis eval bench` — a Genesis-vs-bare-Claude A/B benchmark you can run
  in one command.** Each task in a private task set runs through two arms: a
  cognition-enabled Genesis session (identity + read-only recall from your
  real memory) and a plain Claude Code session with zero Genesis context. An
  LLM judge grades both against success criteria written before the run, and
  the paired win-rate lands in the eval tables and a JSON report. Honesty is
  built in: the judge is labeled uncalibrated until it's validated against
  your own verdicts, small pilots print "insufficient data" instead of fake
  significance, and every run proves it wrote nothing to production memory —
  recall's own usage counters are suppressed for the run so benchmarking
  never distorts what your live Genesis considers important.

- **`genesis eval longmemeval` — measure Genesis's memory on a public
  benchmark.** Runs LongMemEval, an external long-term-memory QA benchmark:
  each question's prior-conversation "haystack" is loaded into a throwaway
  memory store built from scratch (so your real memory is never touched), then
  Genesis recalls and answers, and the standard gpt-4o judge grades it — giving
  a number you can compare to published results. It reports accuracy per
  question type and across two query styles (the raw question vs. keyword
  terms), so you can see how much question phrasing affects recall. One command
  against the public dataset; nothing about your own data leaves the machine.

- **The API Keys panel now shows how often each provider is causing fallbacks.**
  A provider that is misconfigured or failing — for example one whose key is
  missing yet is still wired in as the preferred choice on many call sites — used
  to read only "missing (fallback active)" with no sense of scale. Each provider
  row now shows "in N fallbacks (24h) · last …" beside its key status, so an
  ongoing fallback storm is visible at a glance instead of hiding in the logs.

- **Your credentials now survive losing the whole container.** Genesis mirrors
  its encrypted credential bundle (secrets, SSH keys including the guardian
  control-plane key, and Claude/GitHub credentials — all GPG-encrypted) onto the
  host, outside the container's blast radius, and the host guardian keeps a
  second copy the container can't touch. If the container is ever destroyed, a
  fresh one can be rebuilt with credentials intact from the host — no network and
  no chicken-and-egg (previously the only backup copies lived *inside* the
  container). The guardian also warns you if that mirror goes stale, so you find
  out backups have stopped landing *before* you need them. See the
  container-loss runbook in `docs/reference/recovery-and-portability-workflow.md`.

- **Genesis now detects and repairs corrupted credential files on its own.**
  If a critical credential or wiring file (`secrets.env`, your Claude Code and
  GitHub credentials, SSH keys, `guardian_remote.yaml`, `genesis.yaml`) gets
  zeroed, truncated, or otherwise corrupted — the exact kind of damage a storage
  outage can cause mid-write — Genesis notices on its next cycle, restores the
  file from your encrypted backup with the corrupt copy set aside for
  inspection, and alerts you (telling you to rotate anything that may have
  changed since the backup). It only ever acts on *proven* corruption, never on
  a file that is simply different, and it validates the decrypted backup before
  touching the original, so a bad backup can never make things worse. The
  host-side guardian is the backstop: it watches the same files and steps in to
  restore them if Genesis is too degraded to heal itself. Restores are
  rate-capped, and installs without backups configured still get the detection
  and alert. Requires the backup passphrase escrow shipped in the previous
  release. (Backup-failure alerts also reach Telegram now — they were being
  silently dropped on installs using the shipped `outreach.yaml`.)

- **Three new honesty-first metric series on the dashboard's compounding
  panel, plus retrieval precision@3.** The weekly eval now tracks how your
  approval gates actually get resolved (by you vs. auto-expired vs.
  fail-closed cancels — unknown resolver values are surfaced, never silently
  bucketed), goal completion (reports "no data yet" instead of a fake 0%
  until goals actually close), and a noise/passivity view (stale follow-ups,
  empty ego cycles, rejected-proposal clusters). Memory retrieval gains a
  precision@3 series alongside precision@5, with judge changes marked as
  series breaks. Trend arrows are now honest too: the arrow shows which way a
  metric moved, while its color shows whether that's an improvement — a
  rising noise metric no longer glows green.

- **Genesis can now grow this VM's disk or RAM from the hypervisor — with your
  approval — to fix the one storage failure nothing else could.** When the
  container's storage pool has no room left to auto-expand into (the structural
  cause of a full-pool outage), the only real fix is to add space at the
  Proxmox layer. Genesis can now propose that grow, ask you to APPROVE or DENY,
  and on approval grow the virtual disk and absorb it into the pool — or, if
  Genesis itself is down in the outage, the host-side guardian can do it as part
  of recovery. It is **off by default**, every change is approval-gated and
  rate-capped, grows are one-attempt/never-auto-retried, and only two
  read/write-split Proxmox tokens are ever stored. A grow that Proxmox accepts
  but then fails to carry out in the background (e.g. a storage-permission gap)
  is now reported as a clear failure rather than a vague "couldn't confirm."
  Setup and the full safety model: `docs/reference/proxmox-provisioning.md`.

- **A fresh session now recalls what's already in flight.** When you start an
  interactive session, its opening context now includes a terse snapshot of the
  current working state — active autonomy tasks, live git worktrees, and
  recently-touched plan files — so it can pick up in-progress threads instead of
  starting cold. It's framed as the session's own recollection, not a report to
  read back to you.

- **Backups now cover the credentials and wiring you'd need to actually rebuild —
  and the backup passphrase is escrowed so a lost secrets file can't lock you out
  of your own backup.** The encrypted backup set now includes your SSH keys, the
  GitHub and Claude Code credentials, and the host/network wiring config (the
  difference between "restore" and "reprovision from scratch"). Separately, the
  backup passphrase — which previously lived *only* inside the very secrets file
  the backup encrypts with it — is now escrowed to the host outside the container,
  so a secrets-file loss no longer leaves the encrypted backup undecryptable.
  Restore reads the escrowed passphrase automatically and stages recovered
  credentials to a review directory rather than overwriting live ones.

- **You now get one Telegram when a model provider has been dead for an hour.**
  Genesis already detected a provider failing every call and already showed it on
  the dashboard — but nothing ever told you. The record it wrote was
  high-priority, and only *critical* ones reach Telegram; the matching call-site
  alert is a warning, which the outreach path filters out. So a provider could be
  down for days while the only trace was a dashboard panel nobody was looking at.

  One message, then quiet: it names the provider and how long it has been failing,
  and does not repeat. The hour is deliberate — the underlying record is written
  after about ten minutes, which is right for a dashboard row and far too eager
  for a notification, since most breaker trips resolve themselves. If the provider
  genuinely recovers and later dies again, you are told again.

  Nothing new was added to receive it: this reuses the existing critical-record
  path, so there is no new alert type and no new table. The duration is read
  from the stored outage record rather than from memory, so it survives a
  restart mid-outage without re-notifying — and the hourly check is driven by
  Genesis's own 5-minute awareness tick rather than by provider traffic, so a
  provider that goes quiet after failing still gets reported. One new lever:
  the `provider_outage_notify` setting (`off` / `propose_only` / `live`,
  default `live`; env `GENESIS_PROVIDER_NOTIFY_DISABLED=1` forces off) —
  `propose_only` skips the immediate page (the record still shows on the dashboard, to the ego, and in the next morning report), and
  turning it off resolves any open notification so re-enabling tells you about
  a still-dead provider again.

### Changed

- **The session charter now lists every open ledger item, not just the oldest
  six.** The ledger is a curated list of one-line to-dos, and the old window
  meant a session with more than six open items never saw a newly added one in
  its own prompt — it existed only in the aggregate count. The list is now
  effectively unbounded (a 200-row ceiling with an explicit "more than 200 —
  the rest are not listed" note), and an oversized charter block degrades by
  dropping whole sections with a marker rather than cutting mid-bullet, with
  the open/closed count preserved.

- **Mistral Large is now tracked as a paid provider.** Mistral removed the Large
  model family from free-tier entitlement (unannounced; surfaces as
  `403 tier_not_allowed`). The `mistral-large-free` provider is now flagged
  `free: false`, so its spend is recorded at real rates ($0.5/$1.5 per MTok)
  instead of $0, and call sites marked `never_pays` no longer route to it. The
  provider name keeps its historical `-free` suffix to avoid churning the 30
  chains that reference it. If your account tier still gets Large at $0,
  override `free: true` in your local routing overlay.

- **The Claude Code model roster now ships infrastructure, not a preconfigured
  provider.** `config/cc_roster.yaml` previously shipped a `glm-5.2` peer pointed at
  `open.bigmodel.cn`, which requires Chinese real-name identity verification (实名认证)
  to buy a Coding Plan — so on any install outside China the documented rate-limit
  fallback could not be provisioned at all. The base config now ships only the native `claude` entry
  plus commented examples for both Z.AI platforms (`api.z.ai` international,
  `open.bigmodel.cn` China) and several other Anthropic-compatible providers.

  **If you were using the shipped peer, you must now declare it yourself** in
  `~/.genesis/config/cc_roster.local.yaml`, which is deep-merged over the base file
  and is where the `cc_roster` settings domain already writes:

  ```yaml
  models:
    glm-5.3:
      anthropic_base_url: "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic"
      auth_env: ZAI_CODING_API_KEY
      model_id: glm-5.3
      failover_order: 1
  ```

  This matters because the failure is quiet FOR THE USER: an overlay setting
  `default: glm-5.2` with no matching entry falls back to native Claude, so a
  subscription-cap fallback you believed was configured would simply not engage.
  It is not silent in the logs (`apply_active` logs an error with a traceback),
  and the `cc_roster` settings domain rejects such a write outright — the quiet
  path is a hand-edited overlay.

  `secrets.env.example` now documents all three GLM key slots and which endpoint
  each one serves: a Coding Plan key (`ZAI_CODING_API_KEY`) is required for a roster peer
  because Claude Code speaks the Anthropic protocol, while a general/prepaid key
  (`ZHIPU_API_KEY`) works only on `/api/paas/v4`. Using the general key on a coding
  endpoint returns `1113 Insufficient balance` even when the account is funded.

  The `validated:` field is unchanged but now documented as advisory only: it is
  parsed into `RosterEntry.validated` and then acted on by nothing, so it gates
  nothing. Stale stamps were dropped rather than carried forward unverified.

- **Executor Gate 2 (`17_executor_review`) leads with paid DeepSeek V4-pro.**
  After the NIM repoint moved the free NIM tier from V4-pro to V4-flash, this
  deliverable-quality gate now leads with the paid `openrouter-deepseek-v4`
  (pro-grade) for maximum review quality, with free NIM flash + paid v4-flash +
  qwen as fallbacks. A deliberate cost-vs-quality lever on a quality-critical
  gate; the other repointed sites stay on free flash.

- **Reflection sessions are now strictly read-only.** Genesis's autonomous
  background reflections (deep/strategic) can read freely to investigate, but can
  no longer call any write or action tool — their only output is observations (and
  the structured reflection result the system parses). Previously reflections ran
  with unrestricted tool access and could, in rare cases, mint a follow-up or other
  write from ungrounded reasoning. Relatedly, any follow-up created by an
  autonomous/dispatched session now lands in the recoverable *tabled* lane for
  review rather than directly on the actionable follow-up board — the board stays
  reserved for your (foreground) work. A foreground session can promote a tabled
  item to the board.

- **All autonomous background sessions are now MCP-scoped by default.** Genesis
  runs many kinds of background Claude Code sessions (reflection, sentinel,
  inbox/mail triage, autonomy executor, ego gates, research). These are now secure
  by default: each session loads only the Genesis MCP tools it is explicitly given
  and no longer additively inherits the operator's user-scoped MCP servers (e.g.
  code-editing tools) that were never intended for autonomous use. A session that
  forgets to scope itself now fails closed (no extra tools) rather than open. Your
  own foreground conversations are unchanged — they keep the full toolset. This
  closes a latent tool-scope gap; nothing you'd notice day to day, no action needed.

- **Free-tier model refresh.** Groq is retiring Llama 3.3 70B (the model behind
  several of Genesis's free reasoning/extraction/tagging steps) on 2026-08-16, so
  those steps now use Groq's recommended replacement, gpt-oss-120b. Structured-output
  and extraction quality are unchanged; triage-depth labeling may shift by about one
  level on some items. No action needed on your end.

- **Stale ego proposals get tabled on a generous backstop.** Ego proposals you
  haven't acted on move to the recoverable *tabled* lane on a per-urgency
  schedule (roughly 10 days for critical up to 30 for low) — a backstop behind
  the ego's ongoing reconcile review, tuned to sit well past normal decision
  time so it only clears the genuinely-forgotten. Tabling is reversible, never
  deletion.

- **Setting a dashboard password now also protects the API.** Previously
  `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` guarded only the web pages, while the underlying API —
  including the endpoint that reads and writes your saved keys — stayed reachable
  by anyone who could open the dashboard. With a password set, state-changing API
  calls now require your login session (Genesis's own components authenticate with
  an internal token). The gate is applied in every supported hosting mode (both the
  standalone server and Agent Zero), so no mode leaves the API open. Read-only
  calls and the voice API are unaffected. If one of your own local integrations
  breaks, set `GENESIS_DASHBOARD_API_AUTH=off` to disable just this gate without
  removing the password.

- **The push-approval prompt now appears only on a branch's first push, not on
  every push.** Publishing a branch to the public repo still asks for your
  approval the first time — that's the moment code actually goes public — but
  re-pushing fixes to a branch that's already on the remote (the normal
  PR-iteration loop) no longer re-prompts. A genuinely new branch prompts again,
  pushing to `main` still prompts, force-pushes are still hard-blocked, and
  autonomous/dispatched sessions still can't push at all. The check reads the live
  remote and fails safe: any uncertainty (unreachable remote, ambiguous target)
  falls back to asking.

- **Reflection model and effort are now editable from the dashboard, and Deep
  reflection thinks harder by default.** The model and reasoning effort behind
  each reflection depth — light, deep, and strategic — used to be fixed in code.
  They're now a settings domain you can edit live from the dashboard Config tab
  (a new **Reflection Models** panel), with no restart. These govern reflections
  running on the Claude Code CLI path: Deep and Strategic run on the CLI by
  design, so this is their primary model/effort; Light runs primarily via the API
  free-model chain and uses its value only when it falls back to the CLI. An
  effort control appears only for effort-capable models — switch a depth off Haiku
  and an effort setting surfaces (Haiku ignores effort at dispatch). The defaults
  also move to the new `xhigh` reasoning tier: Deep steps up from `high`, and
  Strategic settles at `xhigh` (from `max`).

- **`git push` in an interactive Claude Code session now asks for your approval
  instead of hard-stopping.** This safety hook used to block the command outright
  with no in-session way through; now Claude Code shows you a native approve/deny
  prompt you confirm with one keystroke — a gate the agent cannot self-satisfy.
  `gh pr create` no longer prompts on its own when it can't publish code —
  opening a PR is then just a review request, so `git push && gh pr create` asks
  once (for the push) and a standalone create on already-pushed code doesn't
  prompt at all. Only the one form that can publish — a create with no `--head`
  from a branch that isn't fully pushed, where gh pushes the branch itself — is
  gated like a push; any explicit `--head` (which tells gh to skip pushing) is
  never gated. The "already pushed?" check queries the live remote, so it isn't
  fooled by a stale local reference to a since-deleted branch, and any network
  error just gates. Autonomous/background Genesis sessions stay blocked from
  pushing directly (their real delivery path is separately gated).
  Force pushes stay hard-blocked; branch names that merely contain `-f` (e.g.
  `fix/…-false-positives`) are no longer mistaken for a force-push.

- **Genesis now keeps its own internal event log from growing without bound.**
  The observability event stream — the record of everything Genesis notices and
  does — was the last high-volume table with no cleanup, growing steadily on
  disk. A daily maintenance pass now trims events older than 90 days, matching
  the retention already applied to Genesis's other internal logs. No visible
  change to day-to-day use; it just stops a slow disk leak.

- **Proactive memory recall holds up better when several sessions are active at
  once.** When multiple Claude Code sessions run side by side, each prompt's
  memory recall used to spend much of its time-budget on bookkeeping (usage
  counters, quality metrics) that has nothing to do with the answer — and under
  that load it would sometimes time out and fall back to the weaker keyword-only
  memory (`[Memory·degraded]`). That bookkeeping now runs in the background after
  the results are returned, and the internal tag index refreshes in the
  background instead of stalling the first prompt after a restart. Recall quality
  is unchanged; it just stops dropping to the degraded path under concurrency.

- **Memory recall reads no longer wait in line behind the rest of the system's
  writes.** Everything Genesis does shared a single database connection, so when
  it was busy writing (reflections, learning, other sessions), a prompt's memory
  lookup could sit waiting for its turn — the main reason recall slowed down and
  occasionally dropped to the weaker keyword-only memory when several sessions
  were active. Memory lookups now read through a dedicated read-only connection
  pool that runs alongside the writes instead of behind them, so recall stays
  responsive under load. It falls back to the shared connection automatically if
  the pool is ever unavailable, so nothing breaks — recall is never slower than
  before. Recall quality is unchanged.

- **The proactive-memory hook is now a thin client of the server engine.**
  The Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`scripts/proactive_memory_hook.py`)
  was a ~2,000-line hand-maintained fork of the retrieval engine — its own
  Qdrant search, RRF fusion, and formatting — that drifted from the real
  engine (no reranker, entity lane, or graph expansion). It now posts each
  prompt to the server recall endpoint (`POST /api/genesis/hook/recall`) and
  renders the result, so every memory improvement ships once instead of twice.
  If genesis-server is unreachable the hook degrades to a keyword-only FTS5
  search (clearly labelled) so a prompt is never blocked, and self-heals on the
  next prompt. The fork's content-quality guards are preserved server-side on
  the endpoint path — malformed rows (raw JSON blobs / YAML frontmatter) and
  non-intentional `knowledge_base` ingestions (surplus/recon crawl) are filtered
  out of proactive injection, as before. New knobs: `GENESIS_PROACTIVE_HOOK_MODE` (`server`/`local`/`off`)
  and `GENESIS_PROACTIVE_HOOK_URL` (see `env.example`); `proactive_metrics.json`
  gains a `mode` + `server_ms` field so the fallback rate is observable.
  **Upgrade note:** the memories surfaced per prompt will differ (and improve) —
  the engine's reranker/fusion/intent-aware budget replaces the fork's simpler
  ranking; command turns surface fewer, decision questions more.

- **The voice API is now fail-closed.** Previously, leaving
  `GENESIS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` unset left every `/v1/voice/*` route open to the
  network. Now an unset token disables the voice API (503 + a boot-time
  warning in the server log). **Upgrade note:** if you use the voice API,
  set `GENESIS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` in `secrets.env` and make sure your Home
  Assistant / voice-addon configs send it as a Bearer token — token-less
  setups stop working on this upgrade.

- **Updates are more resilient and briefly less disruptive.** `scripts/update.sh`
  now downloads new code *before* stopping Genesis, so a slow or stalled network
  fetch no longer prolongs the restart — and a failed fetch leaves the server
  running, untouched. The machine-info blocks in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are also
  regenerated *after* services come back up instead of during the offline
  window, trimming the downtime slightly.

- **Finished background-queue rows are now pruned after 45 days.** The internal
  deferred-work queue kept every completed item forever; it now retains 45 days
  of history and drops the rest, so the queue can't slowly grow without bound.

- **Every terminal door now leads to the same persistent session.** Running
  `claude` by hand over SSH or in the dashboard web terminal now lands in a
  persistent numbered tmux slot (`cc-N`, lowest free — the same pool the SSH
  slot hostnames use), with a printed map of your existing slots and how to
  reattach. A dropped connection or closed browser tab just detaches the
  session; walking back in can never spawn a second copy. Previously, manual
  launches got a uniquely-named throwaway tmux session that nothing ever
  reattached to — abandoned launches quietly accumulated as orphaned
  processes. Extra arguments (e.g. `--resume <id>`) are forwarded into the
  slot; opt out per-shell with `GENESIS_NO_TMUX_WRAP=1`. The wrapper updates
  itself on your next `update.sh` run.

### Fixed

- **A model your account tier cannot use no longer stalls the fallback chain.**
  When a provider refuses a call because the plan does not include that model,
  the refusal arrives as an HTTP 403 whose message names the plan or subscription
  you would need. Those are the same words a genuine "you have used up your
  allowance" message uses, so the router read the refusal as an exhausted quota
  and did what that calls for: waited, and tried the same provider again. Since
  the answer can never change, that wait was spent against the chain's overall
  time budget for nothing — measured at several seconds on each attempt.

  Entitlement refusals are now recognised on their own terms. The router gives up
  on that provider immediately and moves to the next one in the chain, and a
  provider that keeps refusing escalates onto the longer hold-out window instead
  of levelling off at half an hour. To be exact about what that is worth: the
  hold-out is identical to the existing one for the first four trips and only
  pulls ahead during a sustained outage, so the gain is in not re-probing a
  provider that has been dead for hours — not in the first few minutes.

  The same correction is applied to an exhausted allowance, which had the same
  problem for the same reason: a spent quota is a billing state, so waiting a
  few seconds cannot change it either, and the limit usually applies to the
  whole account rather than one model — so a single walk could pay that wait
  once per provider it tried. Both now behave the way a rate-limit already did,
  which is to stop asking and move on.

- **SECURITY.md described a posture the code left behind two months ago.** The
  security policy told operators to treat the dashboard API as
  "unauthenticated administrative access" and said the dashboard password
  "protects the web UI, not the programmatic API". Neither has been true since
  the API mutation gate landed: with a password set, state-changing `/api`
  requests require a bearer token or an authenticated same-origin cookie with a
  CSRF check, and `/v1` enforces its own bearer. The doc now says so -- along
  with the limits that decide whether you still need network isolation, because
  you do: the gate covers mutations only, reads stay open, it is inert when no
  password is set, and it has a documented kill switch.

  Corrected in the same pass: the autonomy ladder was described as seven levels
  (`L0`-`L6`) when four ship (`L1`-`L4`, the rest deferred), the per-category
  permissions were described as six categories when there are four, and the
  process-group-kill example was attributed to a PreToolUse hook when it is
  runtime library hardening -- a different guarantee, since a hook cannot be
  bypassed by the agent and a helper only protects its own call sites. The
  guard section also named one linter as the enforcement mechanism for shell
  and URL policy; that linter only ever sees file edits, and the shell and web
  guards are separate programs chosen by tool matcher.

  Newly documented rather than corrected: provenance stamping and the two
  privileged-write paths gated on it, the approval requirement and journal now
  standing in front of irreversible entity merges, session-id validation before
  filesystem use, and an External Egress section that says plainly which
  outbound channel actually enforces a gate today and which are only observed.

- **A graph backend that cannot answer no longer erases the shield's memory.**
  "The graph store is unreachable" and "no bridge memories exist" used to look
  identical — an empty answer — so a missing library or unreachable backend
  made the nightly centrality pass wipe its cache, and the importance shield
  then protected nothing until the backend came back AND the pass re-ran.
  Unavailability is now its own loud signal: the pass keeps the previous
  bridge-node population standing and says why, while a genuinely empty graph
  still supersedes stale rows. Two writers also stopped leaving the cached
  graph stale: superseding a memory now tells the graph about the new
  succession edge, and the integrity sweep that purges a dead memory's edges
  now invalidates the cache it just made wrong.

- **A schema rebuild no longer destroys columns a private fork added.** The
  ledger table rebuild (widening a constraint means rebuilding the table on
  SQLite) copied a hardcoded upstream column list and then dropped the old
  table — so on an install whose supported private fork had added its own
  column, that column and all of its data were silently, irreversibly gone.
  The rebuild now reads the live table first, re-creates any column it does
  not recognize from that column's own declaration, and copies its data; the
  one shape it cannot re-create (NOT NULL with no default) stops the
  migration with a clear message before anything is dropped.

- **When every provider fails, the log now says which ones.** A routing failure
  recorded only how many attempts were made — but a provider skipped because its
  circuit breaker is open, its API key is missing, or the budget is spent costs
  no attempt at all, so "2 attempts" on a seven-provider chain looked exactly
  like a two-provider chain that was fully tried. The exhaustion event and result
  now name every provider involved, alongside how many the chain had to offer —
  and the log line keeps the two kinds apart: providers whose call actually
  failed print under `failed:`, providers passed over before any call print
  under `skipped:` with the reason (no API key, breaker open, budget exceeded),
  because a never-called provider labelled "failed" reads as an outage where
  there may be none. One-time cost of reshaping the message: the Errors
  dashboard keys manual resolutions on the message prefix, so an exhaustion
  group resolved before this change reappears once under its new key — resolve
  it again and it stays resolved.

- **The temp-space watchdog no longer severs cross-session messaging when it
  goes nuclear.** At its most aggressive cleanup tier the watchdog deleted every
  top-level directory of Claude Code's working temp — including the directory
  holding each live session's messaging socket. The sockets are zero bytes, so
  deleting them reclaimed nothing, while every running session silently became
  unreachable to its peers until restarted. The nuclear sweep now spares unix
  sockets (and only them — all reclaimable bytes are still deleted) and logs
  how many it preserved.

- **Marketing campaign updates now post to their own Telegram topic.** The marketing
  campaign's tick updates previously routed to the shared Morning Reports topic; they
  now go to a dedicated "Marketing" forum topic via a new `marketing` outreach
  category, keeping them separate from the morning report and other digests. Existing
  installs pick up the category automatically on restart (an additive schema
  migration); the morning report and all other topics are unaffected.

- **Proactive memory recall could time out completely.** The embedding provider
  queues standard-rate requests when a model is busy, and that wait can run past
  recall's four-and-a-half-second budget — measured at eight to thirteen seconds
  against a budget of four and a half — so every lookup fails and sessions run with
  no recalled memory at all. Recall now asks for the provider's priority lane, which
  answers in about 650 milliseconds regardless of how long the prompt is.

  **This costs a little more, and the amount is worth knowing: one and a half times
  the standard embedding rate, on recall only.** At one person's usage that is a
  fraction of a cent a month, and declining it means keeping a feature that does not
  work. Storing memories stays on the standard rate — that runs in the background
  with nothing waiting on it. Set `GENESIS_EMBED_PRIORITY_TIER=false` to decline the
  faster lane; recall then falls back to keyword-only search whenever the queue is
  longer than the deadline.

  Scope: this covers the proactive-recall path served by genesis-server. An explicit
  `memory_recall` tool call through a standalone MCP process still uses the standard
  lane, so it can be slow without failing.

  The setting is a yaml lever as well as an environment one, and the template no
  longer overrides it: a fresh install copies `secrets.env.example` to `secrets.env`
  and the environment is read first, so an uncommented assignment in the template
  would have quietly outranked `memory.embed_priority_tier: false` and left the
  documented opt-out doing nothing.

- **The setup script's questions about local inference servers had no effect.** The
  same shadowing applied to the Ollama and LM Studio addresses: the template assigned
  them, a fresh install copied that to its environment, and the environment outranks
  the config file — so the address the interactive setup script asks for was written
  to the config and then ignored, and every call went to localhost regardless. Those
  assignments are now commented out; the values they held were already the defaults.
  The Ollama on/off switch deliberately stays assigned, because unlike the addresses
  its default differs from the template value, and removing it would switch Ollama on
  everywhere.

- **A malformed config section could quietly weaken the private-data scan.** The
  fingerprint harvester, which collects this install's private values so they can be
  blocked from ever reaching a public push, read config sections the same unguarded
  way — and its error handling covers the whole harvest, so one bad section dropped
  not just the addresses it was reading but the timezone and private-repository
  patterns queued behind them, with nothing logged. Sections are now read defensively
  there too. Separately, ignoring a malformed section is no longer silent anywhere: it
  logs which section was discarded and that defaults are in force, because two of
  those settings fail toward spending money and toward running an autonomous job the
  operator had switched off.

- **Model routing ignored the install config, so half the system talked to the
  wrong machine.** Settings like the local inference server's address are resolved
  in one documented order — environment, then the install config file, then a
  built-in default — but the routing layer expanded its placeholders from the
  environment alone. That was invisible while the template forced the same values
  into the environment anyway; removing those assignments so the config file could
  work is what exposed it. An install pointing at a remote inference server ended
  up with its dashboard, health check and embeddings reaching that server while
  routed model calls still went to localhost. Routing now resolves those settings
  the same way everything else does, which also means the setup script's questions
  about local inference finally take effect. An environment variable still wins
  where one is set, and any placeholder without a matching setting behaves exactly
  as before.

- **A quoted "false" in the install config meant true.** Settings written in
  `genesis.yaml` are read as booleans, but a value in quotes arrives as text, and
  any non-empty text counted as on — so `embed_priority_tier: "false"` kept the
  paid lane running, while the same word unquoted, or written in `secrets.env`,
  correctly turned it off. One intention, three places to write it, two answers.
  The same spellings now mean the same thing everywhere, for every on/off setting
  in that file.

- **An override set from the dashboard could never be unset again.** Some settings
  can be given a value in the config file or overridden in the environment, and the
  environment always wins. The settings editor could set those overrides but had no
  way to clear one, so the first time you typed a value there it took over
  permanently — later edits to the config file appeared to do nothing, with no way
  back short of hand-editing the file the editor exists to avoid. Clearing the field
  now removes the override and hands the setting back to the config file. Required
  credentials still cannot be blanked.

- **A config file that was unreadable as settings was ignored in silence.** A
  malformed section already said so; a malformed file did not, even though it still
  contained everything the operator had written — including the switch that keeps
  memory lookups off the paid lane. It now says plainly that the whole file is being
  ignored and where it is.

- **The timezone control could delete the config it exists to repair.** If the
  file was malformed in a way that left its contents unreadable as settings, the
  dropdown rewrote it with the timezone alone — discarding whatever else was in
  there, silently, on the one control documented as the way to recover. It now
  copies the original alongside first, writes the timezone, and says plainly what
  it did and where the copy went.

- **Settings the template ships commented out disappeared from the dashboard.**
  Some defaults are deliberately left commented so the equivalent setting in
  `genesis.yaml` keeps working. The dashboard's editor only recognised
  uncommented lines, so those keys vanished from it and updates were rejected as
  unknown — including several that had been invisible this way for some time.
  They are listed again, simply with no value set.

- **A one-line typo in the install config could silently disable vector memory.**
  Accessors that read a nested setting out of `~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml`
  assumed the section around it was a mapping. Two shapes an ordinary edit produces
  are not: a section whose only child is commented out (which yaml reads as empty
  rather than absent), and a section given a plain value instead of a block. Either
  one raised on the next read, and because the memory subsystem catches everything
  around its own startup, the install would come up reporting a degradation and then
  run with no vector memory at all — from a config file the operator is invited to
  edit by hand. Every such setting — the local inference URLs, the Ollama switch, the
  recall priority lane, the build lane, the models-file synthesis job, and the GitHub
  identity — now falls back to its documented default instead, as does a config file
  whose top level is malformed outright.

- **A session slot started after another tmux server no longer gets the wrong
  temp directory.** A new slot created while a tmux server started in some other
  context is already running used to inherit that server's temp directory
  (often the small system `/tmp` Genesis keeps Claude off of). The temp
  directory and the OAuth-durability setting are now pinned to the slot
  explicitly (when a usable temp directory exists at all — if none does, the
  session is left on the system default rather than pointed at a bad path).

- **The cold-marketing campaign no longer re-pitches the same person.** Once a
  marketing pitch is delivered to a prospect, that prospect is marked contacted and
  drops out of the campaign's target list — previously nothing recorded the contact,
  so the campaign would have re-pitched every delivered target on each run. Works on
  both the owner-approved and (future) autonomous send paths; a pitch that never
  delivers (dropped, expired, or rejected) leaves the prospect eligible for a later,
  re-worked pitch. (The substrate still ships off by default.)

- **Campaign names stored before the control-character fix are now cleaned at
  startup.** Names have been sanitized at the write boundary since the previous
  release, so nothing new lands malformed, but rows written earlier were never
  repaired. The cleanup now runs during campaign initialization, before the
  scheduler registers its jobs — the ordering matters, because each campaign's
  scheduled job is keyed by its name, and renaming afterwards would leave the
  running job pointing at a name that no longer exists. A campaign whose cleaned
  name would collide with another campaign's is left untouched and logged rather
  than merged.

  A campaign's history now travels with the rename — both its durable health
  record and its individual run history. Leaving either behind was not merely
  untidy: an abandoned health record keeps reporting the job as stale on every
  health sweep, indefinitely, because nothing checks whether the job still
  exists; and the run history is looked up by exact name, so a scheduled-job
  prediction spanning the cleanup would have been scored against a series with a
  hole in it, or discarded as having no runs at all. Where the name being moved
  into already carried an abandoned record from a deleted campaign, the campaign's
  own live history now wins and the leftover is removed — previously the reverse
  happened, keeping the record that could never be written to again.

  One name is now refused outright: a campaign called `pending_reaper` collides
  with an internal job the scheduler registers for itself, and would have been
  evicted at startup with no error and no log — it would simply never run again.
  It is rejected when a campaign is created, and a stored name that would clean up
  into it is left alone, since a name with a stray invisible character still runs.

- **YouTube transcripts are less likely to come back quietly incomplete.** When
  Genesis fetches a video transcript it now asks for both English caption tracks and
  prefers the original ASR (`en-orig`) over the `en` variant. Observed once: the two
  were served as different transcriptions — different cue segmentation, and different
  wording in the closing lines — while the same video served identical tracks hours
  later. The cause is unknown and it did not reproduce, so this is insurance rather
  than a diagnosed fix, but preferring `en-orig` costs only one extra small download.
  Two real bugs fixed alongside it: the cleaning step left a stray whitespace-only
  line in every transcript (a caption file carries both empty and single-space lines,
  and the old filter matched only the empty ones), and the documented recovery path
  for a video with no English captions could not work — dropping `--sub-langs`
  narrows the request to one English-first track instead of broadening it, so it
  could never surface the other languages it promised.

- **The `deliberate` MCP tool ("Model Fusion") no longer fails on real prompts.** Two
  distinct bugs: (1) analysis mode 404'd because the orchestrator slug
  `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free` was retired from OpenRouter's catalog (`:free` variant gone)
  — switched to the live base slug `openai/gpt-oss-120b`; (2) real multi-paragraph prompts
  false-timed-out at 240s (a 6-model frontier panel + judge legitimately runs several
  minutes, while a trivial ping finished in ~33s) — the budget is now a single env-driven
  knob (`GENESIS_DELIBERATE_TIMEOUT_S`, default 1000s) read per-call and threaded through
  `core.deliberate()` (which previously hard-pinned 240s, silently overriding the backend
  default). Also hardened the panels' one remaining concrete `x-ai/grok-4.3` slug to the
  drift-resistant `~x-ai/grok-latest`.

- **The morning report no longer cries "surplus heartbeat overdue" during a long
  healthy dispatch.** Surplus emits its subsystem heartbeat only at the end of a
  dispatch cycle, and a single healthy dispatch can run 15-30 minutes — longer than
  the old 10-minute overdue threshold — so a busy-but-healthy surplus was flagged
  "heartbeat overdue" in the morning report and the subsystem-heartbeats view. The
  threshold is loosened to 3 hours, matching the surplus dashboard tile's own
  liveness bound; a genuinely dead surplus is still caught within ~15 minutes by the
  scheduler watchdog, which reads a separate, per-dispatch signal.

- **A partial write to the concurrent-session record no longer erases fields it
  was not told about.** The row has several writers that each know a different
  part of it, and all but one of its columns were overwritten unconditionally —
  so a writer that simply did not know the model wiped the stored one. The
  model cache holds a bounded number of sessions, so a long-lived session whose
  entry had aged out would destroy its own model on the next write. Every
  content column is now preserved when a writer omits it; only the source tag,
  which has a real default, is still overwritten.

- **The Queues card could report "healthy — queues are clear" for counters it
  never collected.** When the queues section of the health snapshot fails, it is
  replaced wholesale by an error marker carrying no per-counter detail. The
  card's verdict only inspected the per-counter error list, so it read every
  depth as a missing zero and returned a confident green — displayed beside the
  panel's own "Queue data unavailable" notice, and folded into the overall
  dashboard status. Unmeasured zeros are now reported as unknown rather than
  healthy. Relatedly, the "not a confirmed zero" notice was keyed on a list
  shared by all four queue sources, so an unrelated counter failing printed it
  above a correctly-counted list of discarded rows; it is now scoped to
  failures of the count it actually describes.

- **The `/genesis/monitor` page had the same discarded-count bug, plus a worse
  variant: rows you could not clear.** Its "Clear All Discarded" button was shown
  only when the 20-row sample held more than one entry, while its label printed
  the true count — so a backlog whose sample failed to load displayed
  "Discarded (148)" with no clear control at all. The button now follows the real
  depth, and appears even when that depth could not be read — it deletes every
  discarded row regardless, so withholding it was what stranded the backlog. The
  header labels the sample as truncated. (A queue holding exactly one row still
  shows no clear-all button — that row is cleared by its own Clear control,
  which is the intended behaviour.)

- **Dashboard reported the discarded-queue depth as 20 when it was 148.** The
  Queues panel and the attention strip both rendered `discarded_items.length` —
  the length of a deliberately capped `LIMIT 20` review sample — instead of
  `discarded_count`, the true unbounded depth the backend already supplied. Any
  backlog above 20 therefore displayed as exactly 20, and because the displayed
  number equalled the cap it looked like a plausible total rather than a
  truncation. The depth and the review sample are now reconciled ONCE, by the
  backend, and published as a single object; every surface renders what it is
  given rather than deciding for itself which of two numbers to believe. So the
  panel can no longer claim a backlog while showing "no items awaiting review",
  disable the button that clears it, or report 0 while listing rows. The review
  list is labelled "showing 20 of N" whenever it is truncated, so the sample
  cannot be mistaken for the whole queue, and a depth that could not be read is
  now reported as unknown instead of as an empty queue — with the clear-all
  control still available, since it removes every row regardless of what was
  counted.

  **API change:** the health snapshot's `queues` section gains a `discarded`
  object (`total`, `sample`, `sample_truncated`, `known`). The previous
  `discarded_count` and `discarded_items` keys remain, and are now derived from
  that object. `discarded_items` is unchanged. `discarded_count` changes in two
  states, both toward honesty: when the depth query fails it reports the rows
  actually in hand rather than 0, and when the depth and the sample disagree it
  reports the larger rather than the depth alone. Anything reading it as "the
  queue depth" — including the >100 queue-depth alert — keeps working and
  under-reports far less in those states: where a failed count previously
  yielded zero, it now yields the rows actually in hand.

  A depth is reported as EXACT whenever the read that produced it was complete,
  not merely whenever the count query happened to succeed. A review sample read
  under a `LIMIT` of one past the cap that comes back short has exhausted the
  matching rows at its own snapshot, so it is the depth — which means a small
  queue is now reported exactly even while the count query is failing, instead
  of as "5+" beside a "queue data unavailable" notice for a number that had in
  fact just been measured. It also means a count that disagrees with a complete
  sample no longer influences the total in either direction: a count taken
  before rows arrived reads low, and one taken before a prune removed them reads
  high, and neither can be detected by comparing two reads that never shared an
  instant. Only a TRUNCATED sample still depends on the count, and there the
  total is published as a floor unless the count is consistent with it. The
  remaining exposure is stated rather than hidden: with a truncated sample, a
  prune landing between the two reads can still publish an inflated depth as
  exact for one cache window; closing that needs both values read under one
  snapshot and is tracked separately.

  The Queues card's verdict follows the same principle: a diagnostic no longer
  doubles as an answer to "is this counter known". The card previously read any
  entry in the section's error list as an uncollected counter, so once a depth
  could recover from whichever read completed, an exactly-measured queue
  rendered a precise number beside "some queue counters could not be collected".
  Errors are not suppressed — they stay in the payload and the panel still shows
  them — they simply stop deciding a verdict they no longer describe. Counters
  that publish no exactness of their own are unaffected, and one unrecovered
  error alongside a recovered one still marks the section unknown.

- **"Clear all reviewed" now says how many rows it will actually delete.** It
  always deleted every discarded/expired row, not the 20 displayed — harmless
  while the panel hid the difference, misleading once it reports the true
  depth. The button reads "Clear all N" with a tooltip stating it is permanent
  and covers rows not shown.

- **Clearing the queue no longer leaves the dashboard showing the rows it just
  deleted.** The health snapshot is cached for up to 30s and nothing invalidated
  it, so the client's immediate refetch re-rendered pre-delete counts: a
  "Cleared 148 discarded items" toast beside a panel still listing them, with
  per-row Clear buttons that silently did nothing. Mutations now bust the cache.

  The cache moved into the health service, alongside the computation it caches,
  and is reached only from the event loop — invalidation raised from a web
  request is handed to the loop rather than touching shared state across
  threads. A snapshot whose computation began before a mutation is never
  published and never handed to a caller that arrived after it, so a cleared
  queue cannot reappear for the rest of the cache window. On a host that
  configures no event loop for that hand-off (an embedded plugin host, where
  invalidation runs on the request thread instead), the cached value is read
  once and reused rather than tested and then re-read, so an invalidation
  arriving mid-read can no longer make the endpoint fail outright. Callers that need
  current data are unaffected: only this endpoint accepts a cached result, and
  it says so explicitly.

- **The ego's self-model stopped presenting stale, thin and arbitrarily-ranked
  rows as present-tense capability.** `capability_map` feeds three ego-prompt
  sections and the capability-improvement scanner. Measurements below come from
  two live installs, distinguished as **A** (627 rows) and **B** (2102 rows) —
  they differ because the flag-gated Outcome-Bus feed is on for A only.

  *Thin rows.* Sources 5 and 6 already refused to emit a signal below 3 samples;
  the journal / proposals / autonomy / procedural sources had no floor. Since
  `procedural_memory.task_type` is a per-item slug rather than a category, that
  left the large majority of the map as one-procedure "domains" — 596 of 597 on
  A, 2066 of 2067 on B. On B they reached the ego: two single-procedure rows sat
  in the rendered top-15, outranking a domain with n=70. The floor now applies
  to the COMBINED sample size in `compute_capability_map`, and again on read, so
  rows written before it existed are not still surfaced.

  *Stale rows.* `updated_at` records when the AGGREGATOR last wrote a row, not
  the age of its evidence. Only 3 of the 6 sources are time-windowed
  (ego_proposals / cc_sessions / outcome_events, 30d); intervention_journal,
  autonomy_state and procedural_memory are not, so domains fed only by those
  never age — correct for present-tense state such as lifetime counters and
  currently-stored procedures, and a documented wart for the journal's
  historical events. The honest uniform reading is "the aggregator stopped
  vouching for this row N days ago". For windowed-source domains the effect was
  real and measured **on B**: a 43-day-old `1.0` at #2 in the rendered
  self-model, and a **93-day-old** `0.0` row at the top of `get_weakest`,
  steering the improvement scanner at a domain with no qualifying evidence since
  May. Prompt-facing reads now exclude rows more than 14 days behind the
  freshest. **On A the window excludes nothing** — maximum observed lag there is
  6 days.

  *Arbitrary ranking.* Confidence is a ratio, so well-exercised domains pile up
  at exactly `1.0` — 19 such rows on A, more than filling a 15-row table. With
  no secondary sort key SQLite returned an arbitrary 15, and an `n=3` row
  displaced one with `n=3276`. Both bars are powerless here because every tied
  row clears them; on A the top-15 was byte-identical before and after
  filtering. The prompt read and `get_weakest` now break ties on
  `sample_size DESC`, which is what actually changes A's rendered table
  (`code_index` n=94 and `model_eval` n=44 replace four n=3 rows). Confidence
  remains the primary key, so a very-high-n domain scoring slightly below `1.0`
  can still fall outside the top-15; reworking the primary ranking is out of
  scope here.

  *Anchor safety.* The window anchors on the freshest USABLE row — date-shaped,
  parseable, not in the future. Anchoring on the freshest row rather than
  wall-clock means a totally dead refresh job ages the table uniformly and hides
  **nothing**, instead of blanking the self-model the moment the scheduler
  breaks. The other direction matters too: `MAX()` is unbounded above, so a
  single row stamped ahead of real time would otherwise define the window for
  every other row and hide all of them silently — and self-perpetuatingly, since
  nothing rewrites a domain that has stopped being emitted. Future rows are
  therefore EXCLUDED from the anchor rather than the anchor being clamped after
  the fact: clamping leaves a uniformly-old table entirely outside the window. A
  partial refresh outage remains uncovered and is tracked separately.

  *Reads split by intent.* `get_all` and `get_by_domain` stay raw accessors;
  `get_prompt_rows` and `get_weakest` carry the policy, so a future non-prompt
  consumer cannot inherit ego-prompt filtering by accident. A new `count_all`
  lets a renderer tell "the map is empty" apart from "every row was filtered" —
  two states that must not produce the same sentence, since each is a false
  claim in the other's situation. All three renderers now distinguish them and
  name the real row count when rows were withheld.

  *Anchor totality.* A `COALESCE` fallback to wall-clock is retained as
  belt-and-braces. It is not an active guard: the anchor subquery filters on the
  same predicate as the outer read, so it yields NULL only when no row passes
  the outer predicate either and the result is empty regardless. It is kept so
  the two cannot silently diverge later without a fallback already in place.

  Three consequences are deliberate. **(1)** The light-depth "avg confidence"
  figure moves sharply — `0.06 → 0.94` on A. The old number was not a capability
  average at all: dominated by hundreds of zero-confidence one-sample rows, it
  reported roughly "what share of stored procedure slugs carry confidence".
  That branch renders no table, so it now states both figures as the qualifying
  subset rather than as whole-map facts — left unqualified it read "31 domains
  tracked (avg 94%)" over a 627-domain map averaging 6%.
  **(2)** "N domains tracked" drops for the same reason (`627 → 31` on A,
  `2102 → 19` on B); the renderers show a top-15/top-12, so those tables stay
  full. **(3)** The focused-deficiency line reads `get_by_domain` — deliberately
  unfiltered, since a capability-improvement cycle targets a domain *because* it
  is weak — and is resolved BEFORE the empty-table check, so it survives even
  when every row is filtered out. It now also stamps the row's last-vouched
  date, because an unlabelled unfiltered row is exactly the present-tense claim
  on old evidence this work removes elsewhere. All three renderers' empty states
  now say rows were filtered rather than claiming no data exists; the base
  builder additionally stopped rendering a query failure as an empty map.

  *Withheld rows are named at every depth, and light means light.* The
  dropped-row report reached the empty and deep exits but not the light one —
  where it matters most, because that branch renders no table and so leaves the
  reader nothing else to notice a loss by (the same call is what LOGS, so an
  operator got no signal either). Separately, the Genesis renderer ACCEPTED a
  `depth="light"` request and rendered the full fifteen-row table anyway: the
  caller believed it had asked for the cheap form and was billed for the
  expensive one. Both now honour it, sharing one sentence rather than two
  copies — on a branch with no table the sentence is the entire claim, so a
  figure qualified in one renderer and unqualified in the other is the same
  "one field, two truth claims" defect from the other side. Neither was
  reachable through today's focus profiles: of the seven,
  `capability_performance` is `deep` in three and `skip` in four, and the
  fallback used for an unknown focus type is `deep` — never `light` anywhere,
  and the compaction layer only ever upgrades a section's depth. So this is a
  latent fix, not a live one. What made both survive review is the more useful finding: the
  render-state matrix built to catch exactly this class enumerated depth
  *beside* its cross product instead of *inside* it, so all of its cells ran at
  one depth. Depth is now an axis of the product.

  *A negative window is refused instead of silently disabling de-duplication.*
  `intervention_journal.aggregate_by_type` rendered a negative day count as the
  SQLite modifier `'--N days'`, which SQLite rejects, yielding NULL; the
  comparison against NULL is then NULL rather than false, so the exclusion held
  for every row and every proposal was counted twice again — from a call that
  returned a perfectly healthy-looking result. The sibling windowed API already
  refused this loudly; the two no longer disagree. No shipped caller passes a
  negative value, so this closes a trap rather than a live bug.

  Nothing is deleted: rows below either bar stay in the table and stop being
  RENDERED as present-tense capability. They are still read deliberately — by
  `get_by_domain` for the focused-deficiency line, and by `count_all` to say how
  many were withheld — and they simply stop being refreshed.

- **A test no longer reads the wall clock once at import and races the suite.**
  `test_surplus_liveness.py` captured `datetime.now(UTC)` at module import and
  seeded a heartbeat 30 minutes ahead of it; production ages that seed against
  the *live* clock with a 5-minute future-skew tolerance, so the assertion only
  held while under 25 minutes had elapsed since import — the whole suite's
  runtime, not the test's. Past that edge it failed, and a re-run went green,
  so it read as a flake; a 31-run survey put it at roughly 3% of runs. The seed
  is now computed when the helper is called, shrinking the margin from the
  suite's runtime to one test's. Measured on both sides of the boundary against
  real production code: the case passes with 16 minutes of simulated elapsed
  time and fails at 26.

- **SSH slot cap no longer collapses below the running session count.** The
  interactive-slot launcher (`scripts/cc-slot.sh`) sized its cap from
  *instantaneous free RAM* (`(MemAvailable − reserve) / per_session`), so each
  running session lowered free RAM and thus lowered the cap *below* the number
  already running — locking the operator out of a new session (and even
  misreporting "3/2 active") while other apps' memory use silently ate slots too.
  The cap is now a stable function of the box's TOTAL RAM (a new pure, unit-tested
  `genesis.cc.session_cap` helper), so it scales per install, does not shrink as
  sessions run, and ignores unrelated apps. It is **container-aware** — it uses the
  cgroup memory limit and CPU affinity, not host `/proc` values, so a container that
  sees host RAM is sized for its real limit (not the host). Live free RAM is used
  only as an OOM circuit-breaker, and a new session only starts when there is room
  for a full session (never over-committing a swapless box). Any interactive SSH
  login (a slot hostname or a plain shell running `claude`, from a LAN/Tailscale IP)
  is the operator and gets an emergency slot above the safe cap; the cap itself
  never turns it away — when the box is full or memory is tight it offers to reattach
  or end a chosen session to make room (the ended session's transcript persists,
  resume with `claude --resume`), and an ATTACHED session needs an explicit confirm
  before it's ended. Two honest corners still decline: a non-interactive login
  (no terminal to prompt on) is guided to reattach, and a genuine OOM-floor breach
  with no slot to trade is refused rather than risking an OOM. The dashboard web
  terminal / local console (no `SSH_CONNECTION`) is held to the safe cap. Reattaching
  always works. Tunable via `~/.genesis/cc-slot.env`
  (`GENESIS_CC_SYSTEM_RESERVE_MB` / `_PER_SESSION_MB` / `_OOM_FLOOR_MB` /
  `_EMERGENCY_SLOTS`); the gate fails open so it can never strand you. See
  `docs/reference/tailscale-ssh-access.md`.

- **Heartbeat GC no longer lets a clock-skewed future row starve a subsystem's
  liveness signal.** The `keep_latest_per_subsystem` heartbeat GC
  (`db/crud/events.py::prune`) kept the row equal to the per-subsystem
  `MAX(timestamp)`. Because `timestamp` is ISO **text**, a corrupt/clock-skewed
  future row (e.g. `2099-…`) sorts as that MAX and survived the retention window
  forever, while genuine pulses aged out and were deleted — leaving
  `compute_heartbeat_staleness` with only the future row, which it rejects as
  materially-future, degrading the verdict to a permanent `unknown` (a false
  "can't tell" for a subsystem that may be perfectly healthy or truthfully
  stale). The GC now uses two distinct future bounds: (a) it deletes only
  *implausibly*-far-future rows (> 1 day ahead — corrupt beyond any clock-skew
  recovery), and (b) it anchors the "keep newest" on the newest row within the
  read-side display tolerance (`observability.liveness.FUTURE_SKEW_TOLERANCE_MINUTES`),
  so the preserved pulse is one the staleness read accepts (`alive`/`overdue`). The
  wide destructive horizon is deliberate: a *modestly*-future row ages into validity
  instead of being destroyed, and a **backward** clock skew at GC time cannot delete
  genuinely-recent pulses. A write-time clamp was considered and rejected: the only
  production trigger is host clock skew, against which a clamp is ineffective (at
  write time `now()` *is* the skewed value), so the retention layer — re-evaluated at
  GC time — is the layer that actually closes the hole.

- **The run_in_background pipe guard no longer false-blocks a `|` inside a quoted
  argument.** The old inline check (`${CMD//||/ }` then `grep -qF "|"`) blocked any
  literal `|`, so backgrounding `gh api … --jq '.[] | .x'` or `grep -F '|' file`
  was wrongly rejected. It's now a small Python hook (`background_pipe_guard.py`)
  using the canonical quote/redirect-aware parser (`shell_parse.has_top_level_pipe`),
  so only a genuine top-level pipe — whose backgrounded stdout really is swallowed —
  blocks; a `|` in quotes, a `||`, or a `>|` redirect does not. (Convenience guard:
  a `|` inside a heredoc body or `case` pattern is a documented residual that may
  still over-block — never a security bypass.)

- **A dead subsystem scheduler no longer reads "healthy" on the dashboard.** When
  a background subsystem's scheduler/loop stops firing entirely (total cessation),
  its heartbeat pulse goes silent — but nothing turned that into a signal, so the
  Ego tile (and the rollup badge) could show green while the egos were dead, and no
  alert was raised. Now the Errors view raises a `subsystem_stale:<name>` alert when
  the ego (→ critical), inbox, or dashboard (→ warning) scheduler goes overdue past
  its threshold, and the Ego tile flips to error ("scheduler stopped — no heartbeat
  in Nh"), failing loud (`unknown`) if the signal can't be read. The alert is
  pause-aware — a deliberately paused Genesis no longer false-alarms — and never
  fires on a merely idle or freshly-booted install. This complements the existing
  "running-but-failing" job alarms, which cannot see a job that has stopped running
  at all. (Surplus already surfaces a wedged/dead loop via its own dashboard tile;
  outreach total-cessation is tracked separately, since its heartbeat only runs once
  a messaging channel is configured.)

- **A subsystem that never started no longer reads "healthy" either.** The
  total-cessation alert above catches a scheduler that ran and then *died*; a
  subsystem that *failed to start* (its bootstrap init raised, or it registered but
  never emitted a single pulse) has no heartbeat at all — which looked identical to
  a fresh, never-run install, so it stayed silent. Now the health check cross-
  references the persisted bootstrap manifest: an enabled ego (→ critical) or inbox
  (→ warning) that the manifest shows failed to initialize, or that registered but
  never pulsed past a boot grace, raises a distinct `subsystem_never_started:<name>`
  alert and flips the Ego tile to error. It fails benign in every ambiguous case —
  a fresh install, a deliberately disabled or unconfigured subsystem, or an
  unreadable manifest never false-alarm — so the only new signal is a genuinely
  broken start. (Covers ego + inbox; a never-started dashboard thread is out of
  scope — it isn't a bootstrap-manifest entry.)

- **The dashboard Surplus health tile no longer reads green while the surplus
  scheduler is wedged.** Its verdict previously came from an activity proxy that
  shows "idle" for a stalled scheduler, so a stuck surplus loop appeared healthy —
  the same class of false-green just fixed for the ego tiles. It now reports a
  genuine stall (no completed dispatch cycle for hours, when not paused) as an
  error, and fails loud (`unknown`) if the liveness data can't be read, never green.
  Thresholds are conservative (3h floor) so a normal quiet system never false-alarms.

- **The Errors view no longer shows a clean "0 errors" when a data source is
  actually down.** The unified-errors endpoint queried each source (events, dead
  letters, deferred work, resolutions, alerts) behind a silent catch, so a DB/FTS
  outage returned HTTP 200 with zero counts and read as "data is clean". It now
  reports which sources failed (`partial` / `sources_failed`); the Errors tab shows
  a "data may be incomplete" banner and suppresses the clean-state check, and the
  overview attention list flags the degrade.

- **Operational Vitals no longer reports embedding throughput as `0` on a query
  failure.** A failed SQLite read for "Points written/24h" / "Pending queue"
  previously wrote a literal `0`, indistinguishable from a real zero. It now
  degrades to `—` with a `throughput_error` reason, distinct from Qdrant
  reachability.

- **A scheduler-heartbeat probe that cannot evaluate now surfaces a WARNING event
  instead of failing silent.** The probe's exception path previously returned
  `healthy` with no signal; it now emits a WARNING (visible on the Errors tab)
  while deliberately keeping the probe result `healthy`, so the remediation engine
  does not treat "can't evaluate" as a downed scheduler and page hourly.

- **Contributor-issue privacy scan no longer over-blocks legitimate Markdown.**
  The `scan_prose` secret-scan floor ran `detect-secrets scan --string <line>` per
  line; argparse then misread any line whose content starts with `-` (a Markdown
  `---` horizontal rule, a `--flag` example — both common in issue/PR prose) as an
  unknown option (exit 2), which the fail-closed nonzero-exit branch turned into a
  spurious BLOCK. Switched to the `--string=<value>` form so the value binds
  literally even when it starts with a dash; secret detection is unchanged for all
  other input. Locked with real-binary regression tests (a `---`/`--flag` body
  scans clean; a planted key still BLOCKs).

- **A transient `git ls-remote` failure no longer re-prompts an already-approved
  branch push.** The push-approval hook prompts only on a branch's FIRST push; a
  re-push of fixes to the same, already-published branch should be silent. But the
  "already on the remote?" check was a live `git ls-remote` that fail-closes to a
  prompt on any network hiccup, so a flaky network re-prompted every re-push. A new
  stdlib allowlist (`scripts/hooks/push_allowlist.py`, state in
  `~/.genesis/pushed_branches.json`) caches the confirmed-on-remote fact locally so
  re-pushes are decided OFFLINE. It is keyed on (branch, remote push-URL set) — never
  the remote name — so the same branch name on a different repo is never conflated,
  and it is written ONLY on a live ls-remote HIT (which proves the branch is already
  on the remote), so it can never authorize a genuine first push. Corrupt/absent
  state and any error fail OPEN to the existing prompt path; entries expire after 90
  days (a recorded branch stays trusted for that window even if its remote copy is
  later deleted).

- **A scheduled job that has run repeatedly but never once succeeded now raises a
  health alert.** Such a job was invisible to every alarm: the "silently failing"
  check needs a prior success to measure a gap against, and the consecutive-failure
  counter resets on every restart. So a job that failed from its very first run —
  e.g. a daily actuator whose external login expired on day one — could fail silently
  for weeks. A new restart-proof check (using the monotonic lifetime run/failure
  counters) surfaces any job with zero successes and repeated failures as a WARNING
  health alert (dashboard + health surface). It is deliberately out of Sentinel's
  auto-remediation scope — a never-succeeded job is a config/auth/code defect a
  service restart cannot fix — and is not auto-escalated to Telegram.

- **The career-outreach monitor now nudges reliably from what it staged, and its
  `observe` mode surfaces a dead career-agent bridge instead of failing silently.**
  The daily monitor used to re-derive its owner nudge by asking the external
  career-agent to enumerate its staged drafts — an unreliable read that came back
  empty, so newly-staged drafts were never surfaced; and `observe` mode could fail
  silently for days when the agent's login expired. It now nudges directly from the
  drafts each tick actually staged (deterministic), and `observe` is a lightweight
  reachability probe that records a job-health failure when the bridge can't answer.
  Still ships `off`.

- **FTS5 recall no longer starves on multi-word queries.** `_prepare_fts5` builds a
  bare space-separated FTS5 MATCH, which SQLite treats as an implicit AND — so a
  verbose query (`reference_lookup` / `knowledge_recall` natural-language text, and
  memory recall on its non-expanded fallback path) required *every* token to be
  present and otherwise returned nothing. A shared `db/crud/_fts.py::fetch_fts` now
  runs the precise AND query first and, only when it returns zero rows and the query
  isn't an already-structured boolean expression, retries the terms OR-joined —
  adding partial matches where there were none while leaving every already-matching
  query unchanged. Applied to the recall surfaces `knowledge.search_fts` and
  `memory.search_ranked` (the latter's `boolean=False` path, which the hot recall
  path falls back to when `expand_query` can't expand, e.g. Qdrant unavailable).
  `memory.search` is left strict-AND on purpose — its only caller resolves entity
  names by `results[0]` and must not be widened to single-term matches.
  Audited-clean: `extraction_job`'s dedup check already OR-joins; `voice/hygiene`'s
  constant-match sweep is unaffected.

- **Ego cycles no longer deadlock when the approval gate is disabled, and the
  dashboard stops reporting a stalled ego as healthy.** With
  `manual_approval_required` set to false, a leftover pending approval row
  (raised earlier while the gate was on) kept blocking both egos' pre-flight
  check forever — cycles silently stopped while every status surface still
  showed "ego active". The pre-flight now honors the gate-off setting (and the
  gate clears the stale row on the next dispatch), so cycles resume
  immediately. Separately, the dashboard and a new hourly liveness check now
  read the ego's last *completed* cycle (not the loop-alive flag), so a stalled
  ego reads "stalled" / "waiting on approval" instead of green — with a
  conservative threshold that never false-flags a legitimate slow cadence or
  quiet-hours lull. The mandatory approval gate itself is unchanged (default
  stays on; nothing auto-approves when it is on).

- **Fresh container installs now get OOM/fork-wedge protection.**
  `scripts/install.sh` (the fresh-container path) never applied the
  memory-resilience provisioning (systemd-oomd pressure-kill, swap invariant,
  raised per-user-slice `TasksMax`) that `bootstrap.sh` and `update.sh` already
  did — so a freshly installed box sat unprotected against the OOM-thrash /
  `Cannot fork` wedge until its first `update.sh` run. It now applies the same
  idempotent, adaptive provisioning at install time.

- **The core Claude Code spawner now uses the shared hardened group-kill.**
  `cc/invoker.py` — the launcher behind every CC session Genesis runs — carried
  the patterns the repo-wide sweep retired everywhere else: `preexec_fn` spawns,
  three `getpgid`-based kill paths (which leak the tree once the leader is
  reaped), two direct-child-only cleanup kills on cancellation/stdin failure,
  and an unbounded post-kill wait. All migrated to `genesis.util.proc_kill`.
  Also hardened: any non-timeout exception escaping the streaming loop (a
  callback raising, an over-limit stream line) now group-kills instead of
  leaking a detached, unregistered session; the graceful terminate-after-result
  stop is bounded and escalates to a group kill if the group survives it;
  post-kill stderr reads are bounded.

- **Dead NVIDIA NIM models retired from routing (silent free→paid fallback leak
  closed).** NIM EOL'd `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-pro` (HTTP 410) and made
  `moonshotai/kimi-k2.6` 404-for-account (both confirmed by live probe). Every
  chain led with a dead free provider, so once its breaker opened those ~14 cognitive
  call-sites silently fell through to paid OpenRouter fallbacks. `nvidia-nim-deepseek`
  is repointed to the live free `deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash-0731` (fast, valid JSON);
  the dead `nvidia-nim-kimi` provider is removed and dropped from every chain (base
  sites fall to `groq-free`, adversarial `_challenge` sites lead with DeepSeek — model
  independence preserved). The eval `judge` keeps the calibrated paid V4-pro first (NIM
  now serves flash, not the calibrated pro), and the `38a` procedure-novelty precision
  gate is pinned to V4-pro only. A new `test_config_invariants.py` locks the dead-slug
  denylist, per-chain non-NIM fallback, `_challenge` model-independence, and a
  deepseek-family judge.

- **Subprocess timeouts no longer orphan helper process trees (repo-wide
  sweep).** Several launchers Genesis runs (the code-review helper, the
  headless/CLI/recovery-brain `claude` runners, promptfoo/pytest eval
  scorers, deterministic step commands) fork their own children; on timeout
  the old kills reached only the direct child, leaving the rest of the tree
  running until reboot. All eight spawn sites — plus the original autonomy
  reviewer, migrated off its private copy — now share one hardened guarded
  group-kill (`genesis.util.proc_kill`): own process group via
  `start_new_session` (never `preexec_fn` — post-fork deadlock risk in a
  threaded server), `killpg` on the leader pid directly (immune to the
  leader-already-reaped race), a `pgid<=1` safety guard, a bounded reap, and
  a logged fallback when the group kill is refused. The contribution CLI
  additionally group-kills on Ctrl+C so an interactive abort can't strand
  its reviewer. The delivery `git push` — which runs under the autonomy
  executor's single-slot semaphore — also gained a hard 300s bound, closing
  the last unbounded subprocess wait on that critical path (a
  network-stalled push could previously wedge all autonomy task execution).

- **Inbox approval-request storm ended.** A stale-hash defect made the inbox
  monitor see phantom "modified" files every 30-minute scan, each time
  cancelling the pending approval and sending a fresh Telegram request — up to
  48 messages a day. The known-hash map is now a single recency scan (newest
  decisive row wins), and new/changed inbox content while a request is pending
  parks onto the SAME request instead of cancelling it: one approval message,
  ever, per outstanding batch — and approving once evaluates everything
  outstanding at that moment.

- **Inbox approvals never re-ask.** Delivered inbox approval requests send no
  reminders (per-policy `reask_overrides` in `autonomous_cli_policy.yaml`,
  `0` = never; other approval types keep their 24h re-ask). A request whose
  Telegram delivery FAILED still retries each scan until one send succeeds —
  that's recovery, not a reminder.

- **Rate-limit-parked background sessions resume faithfully.** A parked
  session's re-dispatch now carries its full execution shape (system prompt /
  strategy doc, attribution tag, skills) instead of resuming with defaults,
  and campaign bookkeeping follows the park to the delivering session's real
  result instead of recording a false failed run (bounded at 7 days so a stuck
  resume can never stall a campaign forever).

- **Test runs no longer trip the temp-protection watchdog.** pytest writes its
  scratch tree under `$TMPDIR`, which on a Claude Code session is the
  budget-policed `~/.genesis/cc-tmp`; a broad suite could fill it and drive the
  `genesis-tmp-watchgod` service into a sustained high-pressure state. pytest is
  now redirected to `~/tmp` (off the budget) for every run rooted in the repo,
  the dev console, autonomy verification, and the eval gauntlet — CI is
  unaffected.

- **Temp watchdog no longer loops on non-reclaimable pressure.** When
  `~/.genesis/cc-tmp` stays over budget after the watchdog's cache cleanup, it
  now re-measures before considering any idle-session reap (so it never reaps a
  session that cleanup already made unnecessary) and, if nothing is reclaimable
  and nothing is safely reapable, raises a single alert instead of re-evaluating
  every poll.

- **Contribution secret-scanning now actually blocks leaked secrets.** The sanitizer
  that checks community-contribution diffs before opening a public PR ran two secret
  scanners — detect-secrets (the required floor) and gitleaks — but both were silently
  finding nothing: detect-secrets' output parser missed every hit because it didn't
  account for the confidence/entropy suffix in the tool's output, and gitleaks was
  invoked with a flag combination that made it scan nothing from its input. A diff
  containing an API token or private key could pass the sanitizer clean. Both scanners
  now work (gitleaks also loads the repo's custom PII rules), and new tests exercise the
  real scanner binaries so this can't silently regress. The privacy scanners for IP
  addresses, emails, and install fingerprints were unaffected. The gitleaks layer was
  further hardened after a security review: a scanner error (bad config, unexpected
  exit) now surfaces a visible warning instead of silently reporting "clean"; the
  scanner's own rules file is pinned to the committed version and is itself on the
  contribution-forbidden list, so a contribution can't weaken the gate that scans it.

- **Autonomy no longer wedges when its cross-vendor reviewer hangs.** A task's
  quality gate runs an adversarial verification through a `codex exec` subprocess.
  That call had no timeout, so a hung codex (a known upstream model-catalog-refresh
  hang) would hold the autonomy executor's shared execution slot indefinitely —
  stalling every queued task until a restart. The call is now bounded by a hard
  timeout (default 2h, override with `GENESIS_CODEX_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_S`); on timeout
  the codex process tree is killed and verification degrades to the next reviewer in
  the chain, freeing the executor. Mirrors the existing hard-timeout on deterministic
  executor subprocesses.

- **No more false "critical failure" alarms when the system is briefly busy.** The
  health signal that watches your local infrastructure (database, vector store, and
  Ollama if enabled) probes those services with a short timeout. When background work
  momentarily stalls Genesis's event loop, those probes could time out even though the
  services were perfectly healthy — firing a spurious "critical failure" that triggered
  a reflection and a Telegram alert. Genesis now recognizes when a probe timed out
  because the loop was starved (rather than because a service is actually down) and
  suppresses the false alarm, while still firing on a genuine outage. A new diagnostic
  also captures what code was blocking the loop during such a stall, to help track down
  the underlying cause.

- **Restricted reasoning sessions can no longer escape their tool restrictions by
  spawning.** Several of Genesis's restricted Claude Code sessions (deep/strategic
  reflection, the inbox/mail judges, and the experimentation completion) could spawn a
  subagent that ran with full, unrestricted tools — escaping the restrictions placed on
  the parent. Their denylists blocked the obsolete subagent-spawn tool name but not the
  current one, nor the `Workflow`/`Skill` spawn paths. These denylists now deny the whole
  spawn class (subagent, workflow, and skill spawns) from a single shared definition,
  with a guardrail test so a new session can't silently reopen the gap. (Working
  background sessions that legitimately orchestrate — e.g. the deep-research `Workflow`
  path — are intentionally out of scope and tracked separately.)

- **Inbox/mail evaluation judges further hardened against adversarial external input.**
  Both judges reason over untrusted content (emails / dropped inbox items) with
  permissions skipped. The mail judge — whose prompt uses no tools at all — now runs a
  full act-nothing denylist (shell, all file-edit, subagent-spawn, side-effecting actions,
  and web tools), and a stale config-path bug that pointed its empty-MCP profile at a
  nonexistent file was fixed. The inbox judge now denies every memory/settings write tool
  (it only ever needed reads plus a single optional observation write), closing a path
  where injected content could mutate stored memory or settings; the denial is derived from
  the reflection read-only denylist, so a future write tool is auto-covered. Two narrower
  residuals on the inbox judge remain tracked (not closed here): it keeps shell access for
  one job — fetching YouTube links — and its retained observation writer is not yet
  provenance-stamped or type-constrained; both are handled in follow-up work.

- **The autonomous-CLI approval gate now ships ON by default.** Every background
  Claude Code session Genesis dispatches must be rooted in an explicit user
  approval — but the committed policy config shipped the gate *off*, so a fresh
  clone would auto-approve autonomous sessions without asking. The shipped default
  is now `manual_approval_required: true`, and a guardrail test pins the committed
  config so the loader's file-wins-over-code-default behavior can never silently
  ship the gate off again.

- **Inbox approvals no longer nag.** A pending "inbox evaluation" approval now
  holds until you respond — it is asked once and blocks until approved, like
  every other approval, instead of re-sending a fresh request every few hours
  for content that hasn't changed. A stuck (orphaned) approval that can never be
  dispatched is still auto-recovered, so the monitor never wedges.

- **A "free" fallback model that was quietly a paid one.** An OpenRouter fallback
  used by several background steps was labeled free but pointed at a paid model, so
  on the rare occasions it was reached it could incur spend that Genesis recorded as
  $0. It now uses a curated pool of genuinely-free models with automatic failover,
  and Genesis warns at startup if any provider marked "free" actually points at a
  paid model — so cost tracking can't silently miss real spend. No action needed on
  your end.

- **Replying "yes" to an approval topic no longer starts a confused new chat.**
  If you replied "yes"/"approve" to the *topic itself* (the forum topic header)
  instead of the specific approval/proposal/content message, Genesis got no
  context and spun up a fresh conversation that answered "I don't have anything
  to confirm — what are you saying yes to?". It now recognizes that case and
  asks you to reply to the specific message (or tap its ✅ button) rather than
  guessing — it deliberately won't act on an ambiguous topic-level reply.

- **Deep reflections no longer silently lose their output.** When a deep
  reflection ended its session with a plain-prose wrap-up instead of the
  required structured JSON (~40% of runs), both parsers failed: the Telegram
  topic showed a "not parseable" stub and — worse — that cycle's cognitive
  output (updated context summary, observations, memory consolidations, and
  follow-up research it wanted to queue) was discarded. Genesis now re-derives
  the structured result from the prose in one follow-up model call, so the
  reflection's findings are kept and the topic shows a real summary. If the
  salvage can't recover valid output, behavior is unchanged from before.

- **Engagement rate now measures real outreach, not your own approval pings.**
  The "N sent / X% engagement" figure counted every internal Telegram message
  Genesis sends *you* — approval prompts, the morning digest, blockers, alerts,
  surplus research posts — as "outreach," so the denominator filled with
  housekeeping and the engagement rate read near-zero even when genuine posts got
  normal reactions. It now counts only messages sent to the outside world (your
  external channels — Discord, email, and the like — rather than your own
  Telegram), so the rate (on the dashboard, in the awareness signal, and in
  reflection) reflects how your actual outreach is landing.

- **Email replies now count as engagement.** When someone replies to an email
  Genesis sent (outreach pitch, follow-up), the reply was recorded for thread
  tracking but never registered as an engagement outcome — so reply rates read
  as zero and the prediction ledger graded every real reply as silence. The
  reply poller now writes the engagement back to the outreach record (without
  overwriting a richer outcome you set manually), so reply metrics and ledger
  calibration reflect reality. Automated messages (out-of-office responders,
  bounces, list mail) and replies from an address other than the one contacted
  are filtered out, so they can't inflate the reply rate.

- **Background work now survives Claude session/weekly limits instead of failing.**
  When Claude Code hit its Max-plan session or weekly usage limit, the message
  ("You've hit your session limit · resets 4:10am") wasn't recognized as a limit
  at all — it was treated as a generic crash, so the background session died and
  its work was lost rather than being parked to auto-resume when the limit reset.
  These limits are now recognized, and the resume is scheduled from the real
  reset time in your account's own timezone (previously a bare reset time could
  be read in the server's timezone and land hours off).

- **No more spurious embedding error on restart.** A one-time procedure-embedding
  repair runs shortly after boot; on some installs it fired before the network was
  warm and logged a scary "all embedding backends failed" error with a full
  traceback on every restart, even though it harmlessly retried on the next boot.
  The repair now waits for boot I/O to settle and retries a cold-start blip before
  giving up, and a not-yet-ready dependency is logged as a quiet, tracebackless
  "will retry next boot" notice rather than an error. Operators can tune or disable
  the wait with `GENESIS_DATA_MIGRATION_BOOT_DELAY_S` (seconds; `0` to disable).

- **Re-embedding a memory no longer downgrades its recall ranking.** When a
  memory's vector was rebuilt (after a vector-store outage, or by the nightly
  repair job), its priority class was silently recomputed from the text alone —
  discarding any deliberate classification and, for reference-style entries,
  re-applying a ranking penalty that lowered how often they surfaced. Rebuilds
  now preserve the stored class. Installs that already drifted are healed
  automatically on update: a one-time pass re-syncs each memory's stored class
  onto its vector (a clean no-op if nothing drifted).

- **Learned procedures no longer overwrite each other.** Genesis identified a
  stored "how-to" procedure by its coarse topic label alone, so two genuinely
  different lessons that happened to share a label would silently replace one
  another — each new lesson destroying the previous one under the same row. On
  one install a single `code_review` row had absorbed (and lost) ~30 distinct
  lessons this way. Procedures are now matched by the similarity of the lesson
  itself: a genuine refinement still updates in place, but a distinct lesson is
  kept as its own procedure instead of overwriting an unrelated one.

- **Legacy procedures with stale similarity vectors are re-embedded on update.**
  The procedure-overwrite fix above matches lessons by similarity, but a
  procedure edited many times before that fix shipped kept a similarity vector
  describing an *older* version of the lesson — which could still misjudge a new
  distinct lesson as "the same" and overwrite it. Installs are healed
  automatically on update: a one-time pass re-embeds each repeatedly-edited
  procedure from its current text so the matching is trustworthy (a clean no-op
  where nothing was stale).

- **Deleting a memory no longer risks leaving an orphaned vector behind.** A
  memory lives across SQLite and a vector store; if the vector store hiccupped
  mid-delete, Genesis used to remove the memory's records but leave its vector
  stranded — invisible bloat that could subtly pollute search, and it never
  cleaned itself up. Deletes are now ordered vector-first and fail closed: if the
  vector store is unavailable the whole delete is deferred and retried, so a
  memory is never left half-removed. A one-time startup cleanup removes any
  existing orphaned vectors (their contents are exported to `~/.genesis/output`
  first) and restores memories that had lost their vector back to full search —
  healing the drift the new Memory Integrity checks surface.

- **Rebuilding a memory's vector no longer resurrects a superseded one.** When a
  missing vector is rebuilt, Genesis re-stamps it with the memory's current
  state — so a memory that was retired or superseded while its vector was still
  pending stays excluded from recall instead of quietly reappearing, and its real
  confidence is preserved rather than reset to a default.

- **Internet outages no longer leave a mess behind.** A long connectivity loss
  used to pile up hundreds of duplicate queued alerts, spam the health view with
  false "delivery exhausted" warnings, and — worst — put Genesis in an endless
  restart loop (it announced "going offline" over and over because restarting
  can't fix a dead network). Now: a repeated delivery failure for the same alert
  is de-duplicated instead of re-queued; a duplicate that was already delivered,
  or an email held for your approval, is treated as done rather than retried into
  a false failure; deferred messages actually expire on their 4-hour deadline
  instead of lingering forever; and the watchdog, after restarting a few times
  for the same reason, backs off and sends you one warning instead of restarting
  on a loop.

- **Genesis now sheds low-priority background work when its providers are
  struggling.** The degradation system that's meant to skip non-essential work
  (surplus brainstorms, the morning report) during a provider brownout was wired
  up but never actually triggered on provider failures — it does now, so a rough
  patch for the model providers no longer drags every background task down with it.

- **Genesis's safety guardrails work again.** The hooks that block dangerous
  actions in Claude Code sessions — force-pushing, `rm -rf` on your data
  directories or database, committing to `main` without a review, writing to
  protected files, booting Genesis against a worktree — had gone silently inert:
  a change in how Claude Code hands data to hooks meant they read an empty input
  and waved everything through. They now read the input correctly and block as
  intended, with a regression test that feeds each guard a real payload so a
  future Claude Code change can't quietly disable them again.

- **Those revived guardrails no longer block harmless commands.** With the guards
  working again, two pre-existing over-eager checks surfaced: the `rm -rf` guard
  mis-read the *rest* of a command — a `2>/dev/null`, a `> log`, or a second line
  — as if it were another path to delete, so a perfectly safe deep-path cleanup
  got blocked; and the "don't pipe a backgrounded command" check counted a
  logical-OR (`a || b`) as a pipe and blocked it too. Both now parse the shell
  correctly, so legitimate commands go through while genuinely dangerous ones
  (`rm -rf /` with or without a redirect, a real pipe in the background) are still
  stopped — covered by regression tests for each construct.

- **When a scheduled job fails, Genesis now records what actually went wrong.**
  Job failures were logged with only the job's name and whatever text the error
  happened to carry — and for the most common failures that text was *empty*, so
  the record read "Scheduled job 'memory_extraction' failed:" with nothing after
  it. Failures now carry the error type and the code location, in both the event
  log and the job-health view, which is the difference between a failure you can
  diagnose and one you can only count. Genesis also now distinguishes a bug in
  its own code from an outside blocker (a provider outage, a rate limit) rather
  than filing both the same way — so "the API was down" no longer looks like
  something to go fix in the code.

- **A failed update that had already run database migrations now rolls the
  database back too.** Previously a rollback restored the code and dependencies
  but left the (newly migrated) database in place, so the rolled-back older code
  ran against a newer schema. Rollback now restores the pre-update database
  snapshot whenever migrations ran (the server is stopped at that point, so it's
  a clean swap), reloads systemd units, and states plainly what it did and didn't
  revert.

- **Recovering from a failed update actually brings the server back.** If a
  previous update failed and left the server stopped, the next update used to
  finish and report "success" while the server stayed down and health was never
  checked. It now detects a recovery run (from the leftover failure record) and
  restarts + health-verifies the server. A server the operator deliberately
  stopped is left alone, but recorded as not-running rather than a bare success.

- **A large one-time data cleanup no longer briefly freezes the running system.**
  Post-startup data migrations (one-off cleanups/backfills of stored knowledge and
  history) run alongside the live system, which allows only one writer to the
  database at a time. A big cleanup used to do all its work in a single long write,
  briefly blocking every other write for ~10+ seconds — long enough that the system
  logged "database is locked" errors and, in one case, had to re-run the cleanup
  after a restart. Bulk cleanups now save their progress in small batches, releasing
  the database between them, and the bookkeeping that records a migration as "done"
  now retries briefly if it hits a momentary lock — so a cleanup is never
  needlessly repeated. (Slow per-record checks were also moved out of the locked
  window.)

- **The dashboard now recognizes updates started from the command line.** Its
  "update in progress" checks previously only saw dashboard-triggered updates,
  so a command-line `update.sh` run could be interrupted (its state wiped) or a
  second update launched over it. The dashboard now consults the same
  deploy-in-progress signal the rest of the system uses, and a dashboard-started
  update no longer runs in the server's own service group (where the update
  stopping the server could kill the update itself).

- **Two updates can no longer run at the same time.** If an update is already in
  progress, a second `update.sh` (from another session, or the dashboard) now
  refuses immediately instead of running concurrently — previously two updates
  could overlap, each stopping the server and merging, and corrupt the deploy.

- **An interrupted update no longer leaves the server down.** If a self-update
  is interrupted after it has stopped the server (a Ctrl-C, a system shutdown,
  or an unexpected failure inside an internal step), it now rolls back to the
  previous version and restarts the server instead of exiting with the service
  stopped. An interrupt *before* the server is stopped simply cleans up and
  exits, leaving the running system untouched.

- **Background sessions no longer get silently cut off after 10 minutes.** A
  long background task (for example deep research running as a background
  session) used to be killed at about 10 minutes with only a partial result and
  no signal. Background sessions now run to completion within their time budget,
  and if any background work is ever cut short by a time limit, the result is
  flagged as incomplete rather than delivered as if it were finished.

- **Updates are more resilient to network stalls, bad merges, and mid-update
  crashes.** Several robustness fixes to the self-update path (`update.sh`):
  network operations (fetching the latest code, post-update health checks, and
  guardian SSH) are now time-bounded, so a hung connection can no longer stall
  an update indefinitely; the pre-update database snapshot is now a
  transactionally-consistent SQLite backup instead of a plain file copy that
  could be torn if the server wrote to it mid-copy; a merge conflict now records
  complete, valid conflict details for the assisting session (multi-line git
  output no longer corrupts that file); and an update that ships a broken
  database-migration module now rolls back cleanly instead of silently skipping
  migrations and running the new code against an old schema.

- **Host setup no longer force-deletes a container it wrongly thinks is
  damaged, or hides an install behind a new disk.** Host-side hardening: a
  container flagged "damaged" is now **renamed aside** (its database, memory, and
  transcripts preserved and reclaimable) instead of force-deleted, and a single
  transient health-probe blip no longer misclassifies a healthy container (the
  probes retry). A split-disk resize only binds the larger disk when the
  container does not already hold an install — never over an existing one, which
  would make it "disappear." Also: the guardian-state reset and `~/.claude`
  ownership now use the real operator account under `sudo` (not root); an
  existing operator-edited `guardian.yaml` is preserved on re-run instead of
  overwritten; a failed shared-mount step degrades gracefully instead of aborting
  the installer mid-way; and re-launching setup to pick up group membership no
  longer mangles arguments containing spaces.

- **Setup and restore scripts no longer risk destroying user data on a re-run
  or crash.** Three install-surface fixes: re-running local-config setup now
  preserves your existing `github.private_repo` and any custom keys (it rebuilt
  the file from scratch before, wiping them) and writes atomically; the shell
  wrapper that setup installs in `~/.bashrc` is rewritten atomically and, if it
  finds a half-written block from an earlier interrupted run, leaves the file
  untouched instead of deleting everything below it; the CC-memory restore never
  overwrites a newer local file with an older backup copy (a `cp` quirk on newer
  systems used to); and local-config setup fails with a clear "install PyYAML"
  message up front instead of a raw traceback after you've answered every prompt.

- **The knowledge base no longer fills with Genesis's own operational
  telemetry.** Background maintenance and eval tasks (DB maintenance, disk
  cleanup, model/J9 evals, backup verification, research/prompt-review
  intermediates) were routing their point-in-time status reports into the
  knowledge base as if they were durable, recallable knowledge — growing it to
  ~71% operational noise and crowding out real ingested content. Those tasks no
  longer write to the knowledge base, a one-time cleanup removes the historical
  telemetry rows on the next restart, and crawled external intelligence
  (model/GitHub/web scans) is now correctly labelled as external-world content
  rather than Genesis's own memory.

- **Per-prompt memory recall no longer silently degrades on busy installs.**
  The server-side recall budget behind the proactive memory hook was sized
  against a dev install that (unnoticed) ran no reranker and a half-size
  corpus; on a loaded production install the real pipeline routinely exceeded
  it, so most prompts fell back to keyword-only recall with a
  `[Memory·degraded]` banner. The budget now matches the measured production
  cold path (4.5s server / 4.75s client, still inside the hook's 10s ceiling),
  the cross-encoder rerank stage is timeboxed at 1s (degrading to fusion order
  rather than eating the whole budget), recall responses report whether
  reranking actually **executed** (not merely was requested — the
  requested-vs-executed confusion is how the old budget got validated), and
  slow recalls log a per-stage timing breakdown to the journal.

- **Restore fails loudly instead of silently doing nothing, and decrypted
  secrets are never briefly world-readable.** Disaster-recovery hygiene fixes:
  an unattended restore with no terminal (and no `--force`) now aborts with a
  clear message instead of declining every prompt and reporting success; a
  restore pointed at an empty or wrong backup fails instead of exiting "success"
  having restored nothing; a failed pull of the two largest payloads (vectors,
  transcripts) is now reported rather than silently skipped; decrypted
  secrets/transcripts/memory are written private-by-default (no world-readable
  window); the backup-failed alert now fires even when a backup aborts early;
  and the plaintext database dump is cleaned up even if a backup dies mid-run.

- **Backups now verify the database archive is restorable, can't collide with a
  restore, and never re-badge stale data as fresh.** Three disaster-recovery
  integrity fixes: the 6-hourly backup now decrypt-verifies the SQLite archive
  with the passphrase a recovery box would actually use, so a
  rotated-but-not-re-escrowed passphrase is caught immediately (and the fresh
  copy is held out of the off-site snapshot until re-escrowed) instead of
  surfacing at disaster time; backup and restore share a lock so the timer can
  never snapshot a half-restored database (a backup skips quietly, a restore
  waits then says who's holding the lock); and the off-site snapshot only ever
  contains payloads regenerated that run — a reachable collection that fails to
  snapshot now fails the backup loudly instead of silently shipping the previous
  run's copy under a fresh timestamp (a genuinely absent or unreachable vector
  store degrades gracefully, since it rebuilds from the database). All off-site
  operations are time-bounded, so a hung network mount degrades to a
  partial-backup alert instead of wedging backups indefinitely.

- **The dashboard no longer shows a false "degraded / sentinel stale" during an
  update.** While `update.sh` restarts the server, the freshly booted server's
  sentinel heartbeat is briefly empty, which used to paint the Services card
  amber ("sentinel stale — last heartbeat Nm ago") even though nothing was
  wrong. The health snapshot now recognizes an in-progress deploy (the same
  signal the watchdog already uses to defer restarts) and shows a neutral
  "deploying" state for that window instead — a genuine fault (an escalated
  sentinel, a down service) still shows through.

- **Voice conversation delivery no longer double-writes turns under a burst.**
  The `POST /v1/voice/conversation` landing did a read-then-append (count the
  transcript's lines, then write the new turns) with an `await` in the middle.
  Because the dashboard serves requests on threads that all feed one event
  loop, two near-simultaneous deliveries of the same conversation (a voice
  edge can fire the same disconnect twice within a second) could both read the
  same line count and both append the same turns, duplicating them in the
  transcript. Deliveries now hold a lock across the read-and-append so the
  turns land exactly once.

- **Legacy voice conversation blobs are swept from episodic memory.** The old
  one-blob landing left duplicated, ever-growing "Voice conversation [...]"
  memories polluting recall (and their vector embeddings polluting semantic
  search). A daily voice-hygiene job now removes them across all storage
  layers; it runs as a standing sweep (not a one-shot migration) so blobs
  written by a voice edge that hasn't been updated yet are cleaned up too,
  and it logs loudly when it finds any — a nonzero sweep after your edge is
  current means a stale producer is back.

- **`update.sh` no longer aborts on Serena's config churn.** `.serena/project.yml`
  is now install-local (untracked): Serena rewrites the file's comment block on
  its own version bumps, so any install running the Serena MCP went permanently
  "dirty" and every update required a manual stash dance. The updater carries
  your live copy through the transition automatically, and fresh clones need
  nothing — Serena regenerates the file on first run.

- **Dashboard health cards stop crying wolf.** The API Keys and Queues cards
  read "degraded" whenever *any* provider key was unconfigured or *any*
  deferred-work item was queued — even when nothing was actually wrong. Both
  now trust the system's own criticality- and age-aware verdict: the API Keys
  card stays healthy when the only missing keys belong to dormant or
  fallback-only providers (and still degrades when a genuinely load-bearing
  key is missing or a provider is out of credits), and the Queues card
  degrades on genuine backlog signals — recovery work, or a processing /
  embedding queue past the backend's own depth threshold — rather than the
  normal in-flight worklist the background drainer churns through.
  The API Keys "N ok / M" tally is also correct now (it previously double-
  counted local providers, so the numbers didn't add up).

- **The Ego card says "needs action" instead of "degraded" when approvals are
  waiting.** Pending ego proposals are a review queue awaiting you, not a system
  fault — so the card no longer paints itself amber-degraded when more than a
  handful pile up. It shows a distinct "needs action" state (its own accent
  colour and ◆ glyph), and pending approvals no longer drag the overall
  dashboard health to "degraded" — they ride along as a note on an otherwise
  healthy system.

- **A long-retired background job no longer haunts the job-health view.** The
  infra-monitor job was replaced months ago, but its stale record lingered and
  showed as a perpetually-"healthy" job (the staleness check only catches jobs
  that run-but-fail, not ones that stopped running entirely). Its fossil record
  is now purged on upgrade.

- **Provisioning approvals can be retried, and never race each other.** A
  grow/limits approval prompt that timed out unanswered used to silently block
  every retry for 24 hours (the generic outreach dedup window treated the
  retry as a duplicate of the expired prompt). Provisioning approvals and
  outcome notices are now never deduplicated — every request reaches you —
  and a new in-flight guard suppresses a genuinely concurrent duplicate
  prompt (e.g. a double-click) so a plain APPROVE reply always resolves
  unambiguously.

- **Messages Genesis sends you now arrive exactly as written — no silent
  rewriting.** Notifications, reminders, and reply-and-wait prompts were
  quietly run through an LLM "drafter" before delivery, which could reword or
  even invert their meaning: a test message asking "please reply with a plain
  message" went out as "…failed, reply to verify," inventing an alarming
  status that was never there. Delivery paths (`outreach_send`, the
  reply-and-wait tool, the queued-message drain) now deliver the composed text
  verbatim, and the internal notification paths that relay a machine fact
  (health-remediation alerts, "update available/failed," session-failure
  alerts, ego notifications, surfaced reflection questions) do the same — so a
  factual alert can never be creatively rewritten into a false claim. Reflection
  questions also keep their full text and every option intact. Generative
  content (marketing drafts) still uses the drafter, as intended.

- **Memory search actually reranks now.** `memory_recall` and
  `knowledge_recall` advertised Voyage cross-encoder reranking and defaulted it
  on, but the recall tools were built without a reranker, so it silently never
  ran — searches returned raw fusion order instead of the promised
  relevance-reranked results. The reranker is now wired into the recall tools
  (no change without an `API_KEY_VOYAGE`). It can be turned off live via the
  `memory_recall` setting `reranker.mode: off` or `GENESIS_MEMORY_RERANK_OFF=1`
  if you want to trade a little recall quality for lower latency/cost.

- **Fresh installs come up correctly the first time.** Several install-only
  defects are fixed: generated systemd units no longer get a broken service
  PATH (missing the npm-global bin dir) when Claude Code isn't on PATH yet at
  unit-generation time, so background services can reliably find the `claude`
  CLI; the triage-calibration and user-knowledge seed files are now populated
  from their templates during `install.sh` (previously only `bootstrap.sh` did
  this), so triage runs with real calibration instead of an empty prompt on a
  fresh install; and the content-pipeline module now honors its declared
  enabled state instead of always seeding disabled.

- **Time-limited internal state expires on schedule.** Two time-to-live checks
  compared expiry timestamps stored in different formats: observations could be
  resolved as expired up to a day early, while same-day cognitive-state entries
  lingered in the morning report as "active" long after they had actually
  expired. Both comparisons are now format-normalized, so internal state lives
  exactly as long as intended.

- **The morning report's numbers are real now.** Report generation previously
  counted truncated display lists (reporting "5 follow-ups" when 268 existed),
  sometimes inverted protective facts into alarms (an active OOM-protection
  service reported as an OOM risk), and — worst — the carefully grounded
  draft was silently re-drafted by a generic model with no grounding rules
  before delivery. The report context now opens with an authoritative
  Ground Truth section of exact totals, truncated lists are labeled
  "showing N of M", protective mechanisms are tagged so they can't be read
  as risks, and the grounded draft is delivered as-is (single draft pass).

- **Reflections stop arguing with themselves about signals that never
  fired.** All reflection depths now see live awareness signals in one
  canonical format (previously light and deep cycles each got a different
  shape, so one cycle couldn't recognize what the other had cited), the
  prompt now clearly separates live tick signals from stored-observation
  history, and a guard strips any signal-by-name-and-value claim from a
  reflection's persisted narrative when that signal wasn't actually in the
  live tick. This ends the loop where a phantom claim ("signal X=0.9") got
  written into cognitive state, re-read by the next reflection, debunked,
  and then re-asserted for days. The guard only annotates — it never blocks
  or rejects a reflection's update.

- **Reflection updates in Telegram are now real summaries.** The reflection
  topic previously relayed the model's raw output, so a malformed reflection
  could leak internal tool-call chatter to your Telegram verbatim. Messages
  are now built only from the parsed reflection fields (assessment, key
  observations, next focus); when a reflection's output can't be parsed you
  get a short "completed — stored for review" notice instead of noise, and
  unparseable output is no longer stored as a reflection summary that later
  reflections would re-read and argue with.

- **Demoted autonomy can actually earn its way back now.** Earn-back
  eligibility used to be computed over a category's entire lifetime record,
  so after a rough patch the math could require months of flawless behavior
  before Genesis would even *propose* restoring a level — in practice the
  demotion was permanent and the system nagged about it forever. Eligibility
  now looks at a recent evidence window (45 days by default,
  `earnback.window_days` in `config/autonomy.yaml`): old mistakes age out,
  recent clean behavior counts, and promotion still always requires your
  explicit approval. While an earn-back proposal is sitting in your queue,
  the internal "autonomy regressed" alarm also calms down instead of firing
  on every awareness tick.

- **The engagement-outcome vocabulary is now actually enforced.** The
  database rule meant to constrain how outreach engagement gets labeled was
  silently toothless (a SQL quirk made every value pass), so labels drifted
  for months and anything could be written. The table now enforces the
  canonical vocabulary, historical stragglers were normalized, and the two
  doors that passed raw client strings straight through (an MCP tool and a
  dashboard endpoint) validate first — a bogus value gets a polite rejection
  instead of a crash.

- **The host recovery brain no longer goes blind on a misconfigured work
  directory.** If the guardian's configured Claude Code work directory already
  exists but isn't writable by the guardian (for example a root-owned
  `/var/lib` path left over from an older install), it now detects that with a
  real write probe and falls back to a user-writable directory instead of
  handing the recovery session an unusable working directory. Previously only a
  *non-creatable* directory triggered the fallback; an existing-but-unwritable
  one slipped through and could blind the recovery brain exactly when it was
  needed most.

- **Disaster recovery no longer risks corrupting the thing it's recovering.** A
  script audit found three ways deploy/restore could bite at the worst moment,
  now fixed: (1) during a database restore, the health watchdog could restart
  the server mid-rebuild — into a half-populated database that the next backup
  would then capture as the newest "complete" snapshot; restore now holds the
  same deploy-in-progress marker the watchdog already honors, so it stands down
  until the restore finishes. (2) The pre-restore "undo" copy was taken from the
  live database without its write-ahead log and then the original was deleted —
  leaving a torn, stale rollback copy exactly when an operator needs to undo a
  bad restore; the copy is now taken after the writer is stopped, via a
  WAL-aware snapshot. (3) The Guardian installer aborted on any host without
  Claude Code already installed — which is every fresh host, since the installer
  runs before Node/CC are set up — because an "optional" CLI probe wasn't guarded
  under strict mode; it now degrades gracefully as intended.
  sending on external channels (email, chat), Genesis scans messages and
  quarantines anything that looks like a leaked credential. Its API-key
  patterns predated today's key formats, so newer shapes slipped through
  unflagged — OpenAI project and service-account keys (`sk-proj-…`,
  `sk-svcacct-…`, `sk-admin-…`), OpenRouter keys (`sk-or-…`), and underscored
  key bodies. The patterns now cover the full modern `sk-*` family, GitHub
  tokens (`ghp_…`/`gho_…`/`github_pat_…`) are recognized for the first time,
  and benign look-alikes (hyphenated slugs such as "sk-learn-pipeline") stay
  unflagged.

- **Idle abandoned sessions can now actually be cleaned up.** The process
  reaper's "is anyone looking at this terminal?" check counted every tmux
  pane as live — including sessions nothing is attached to. Under
  persistent slot sessions that meant an abandoned session could never be
  reclaimed, no matter how long it sat idle. A tmux pane now counts as live
  only while its session has a client attached; a detached session is still
  spared as long as it shows recent activity (so a dropped connection
  mid-work is never at risk), and only one that is BOTH detached and idle
  past the 7-day window becomes a cleanup candidate. The reaper remains in
  observe-only mode — it reports what it would clean up and touches nothing
  until explicitly armed.

- **Answering Genesis's questions with a plain message now actually works.**
  When Genesis asked something and waited for your answer (approvals,
  provision prompts, send-and-wait questions), an internal ordering bug left
  the waiting mechanism blind to where the question had been delivered — so
  a plain (non-quote) reply never matched it. Your answer instead spawned an
  unrelated conversation turn, and the question sat unanswered until it
  timed out. The delivery context is now attached in the right order, plain
  replies match the question they answer, and a tripwire warning fires if
  this ordering ever regresses.

- **Replying to Genesis without quote-replying now counts.** When Genesis
  asked you something on Telegram and you answered with a plain message
  (no quote-reply), your answer reached the waiting conversation but the
  outreach record never learned it was answered — it would later be marked
  "ignored" or "ambivalent" as if you'd said nothing. Only 3 of 1,021
  outreach records ever carried a real reply signal because of this. A
  standalone reply that resolves a pending question is now recorded on the
  outreach record exactly like a quote-reply, so Genesis's picture of what
  you actually respond to stops being systematically wrong.

- **GitNexus stops rewriting your instruction files.** Every reindex used to
  inject a block of "MUST run impact analysis before every edit"-style
  mandates into CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md (contradicting the project's own
  advisory-tools principle) and regenerate its skill files, leaving the
  working tree dirty enough to block deploy pulls. Injection is now disabled
  at the source via a committed `.gitnexusrc` (`skipAgentsMd` + `skipSkills`)
  that reaches every install with a plain pull; AGENTS.md is hand-curated
  (useful GitNexus pointers kept, mandates gone), and the hourly strip job
  stays as a safety net for rc-unaware GitNexus versions — now covering both
  files.

- **Genesis resumes learning about you.** The stream of "user model deltas" —
  the small observations reflections make about your preferences, constraints,
  and working style — had been effectively dead since the v3 release: the
  quality gate demanded more certainty (0.90) than the reflection model ever
  expresses (its honest "high certainty" sits at 0.85), so almost nothing
  passed — 2 deltas in 3.5 months. The gate now matches the model's real
  confidence scale, and the reflection prompt no longer contradicts itself
  about the bar (it demanded 0.9, called 0.85 "high certainty", and showed a
  0.8 example all at once). If the stream stays silent anyway, the staleness
  alarm shipped in the sensor-fabric release will say so within two weeks.

- **Setup now installs the package its OOM protection depends on.** Genesis's
  memory-pressure protection (systemd-oomd) was applied by setup but only *if*
  the `systemd-oomd` package already happened to be installed — on a minimal
  install where it wasn't, setup quietly skipped the whole layer and left the
  box exposed to the exact OOM-thrash wedge the protection exists to prevent,
  with no signal beyond a line in setup output nobody reads. Bootstrap now
  provisions the package before applying the layer, so the protection actually
  deploys everywhere. Idempotent (a no-op when already present) and it never
  forces oomd on a kernel that can't support it.

- **Wing-filtered memory recall stops missing memories it should return.**
  Asking for memories in a specific wing (e.g. `infrastructure`) silently
  under-returned two kinds of rows: memories with no vector (FTS-only) were
  dropped outright because the wing filter had no wing to check against them,
  and thousands of older embedded memories were excluded because their vector
  carried no wing tag even though their record did. Recall now checks each
  memory's authoritative wing (from its stored record) rather than a
  denormalized copy, so FTS-only rows are reachable; and a one-shot supervised
  re-sync (`scripts/wing_payload_resync.py`) backfills the missing wing tag
  onto ~5.3K older vectors so vector-based wing recall returns them too.
  Dry-run by default; the bulk re-sync is gated on a human-reviewed sample.

- **Enabling container swap no longer waits for a restart to take effect.**
  Host setup lets the container's memory cgroup spill into host swap under
  pressure, so a memory spike degrades into swapping instead of thrashing the
  whole box into a wedge. But that setting only took effect the next time the
  container *started*, so retrofitting an already-running install looked done
  while swap stayed off until a reboot — leaving the box exposed to the exact
  OOM wedge the setting exists to prevent. Setup now activates it live on the
  running container, so the protection is real immediately.

- **Genesis's database keeps more in memory and stops over-syncing.** The main
  shared SQLite connection held only SQLite's tiny ~2 MiB default page cache and
  fsynced on every single commit (`synchronous=FULL`), even though the
  standalone connection helper already used the lighter, equally safe `NORMAL`
  mode under WAL. Both connection paths now hold a 256 MiB page cache, and the
  main connection matches `NORMAL` — fewer disk syncs and less page re-fetching
  under load, with no durability loss beyond what WAL already implies.

- **Genesis's inner monologue now knows who each thought is about.** Every
  ambient micro-reflection used to be tagged as relevant to "both" the user
  and Genesis — the tag was computed from which sensors *ran* (all of them,
  every tick) instead of what the reflection was actually *about* — so the
  filter that keeps user-activity noise out of Genesis's self-management
  context never excluded anything. Micro-reflections now report which
  signals drove them, and the relevance tag is computed from that (with the
  old behavior as a safe fallback when the model omits the field). User-ego
  context is unaffected by design: it never ingested these reflections in
  the first place.

- **Recall-time graph expansion got ~5x faster.** The just-shipped 1-hop
  expansion hydrated each linked neighbor with its own database query — and
  because the memory content table is a full-text index (no plain lookup on
  the id column), every one of those was a full scan. On a typical 10-neighbor
  expansion that measured ~750-940ms of pure overhead on the recall path. It
  now hydrates every neighbor in a single batched query (~80-130ms), returning
  identical results. Purely a performance fix — same neighbors, same order,
  same provenance and visibility filtering.

- **A dashboard request during startup can no longer crash the server.** The
  async-route bridge falls back to a throwaway event loop when the runtime
  loop isn't available — but shared database connections are bound to the
  runtime loop, so a health poll landing in that window raised cross-loop
  errors that could take the whole process down (observed as exit code 2).
  Both windows now degrade to a clean HTTP 503 instead: a configured-but-not-
  yet-running loop never executes the handler at all, and the loop-less
  fallback catches the cross-loop failure and logs it rather than crashing.

- **Code-intelligence indexing can no longer storm the machine.** Keeping the
  code graph fresh used to fire a full reindex on every commit, in the
  background, with no coordination — and if disk cleanup had reclaimed the index
  first, each "quick refresh" was secretly a full rebuild from scratch. Enough
  of them at once saturated disk I/O and dragged the whole box to a crawl. Three
  changes fix this at the root: (1) disk cleanup no longer deletes the code
  index except as a genuine last resort (very low free space), so refreshes stay
  incremental; (2) commits and setup now *queue* an index request instead of
  spawning one — a small idle-gated job does the work only when the machine is
  quiet, one at a time; and (3) whatever does run is watched live and
  automatically paused when the system gets busy, so an index can never hold the
  box hostage. Routine refreshes are now the cheap "fast" pass, with the full
  pass reserved for a weekly idle window. Also fixes a latent bug where the
  GitNexus refresh had been silently failing on every run due to an unsupported
  flag.

- **Background research sessions can now reach Genesis's discovery tools, and the
  session queue no longer strands work after a restart.** Research-profile
  background sessions were silently cut off from the recon tools (GitHub and
  model-intelligence discovery, skill scanning, findings storage) — the discovery
  engine they exist to drive — so a research session could investigate but never
  record what it found there; they now load those tools. Separately, if a queued
  background session was claimed moments before a restart, it could sit stuck
  indefinitely; the queue now re-checks for stranded claims periodically, not just
  once at boot. Two smaller hardening fixes ride along: read-only background
  profiles can no longer edit follow-ups (only *create* was blocked before), and
  the executor's plan reviewer no longer suppresses a genuine gap when a task's
  requirements explicitly call for a specific timeout/retry/escalation behavior.

- **The neural monitor's Ego panel now shows real ego activity, not phantom tiles.**
  The dashboard was rendering a few "ego" tiles that looked healthy but never
  actually ran — leftovers from an earlier ego redesign that split the ego into
  two cycles and made its compaction step non-LLM. They're gone, the Ego panel now
  lists the three live ego call sites, and a couple of other stale tiles (triage,
  bookmark enrichment) were removed too. A months-old leftover activity record can
  no longer resurrect a removed tile as if it were live.

- **Memories recovered after an embedding outage keep their wing/room/life_domain
  filters, and keyword-only results are no longer ranked as artificially fresh.**
  When the embedding provider was down, memories were stored keyword-only and
  re-embedded on recovery — but the rebuilt vector dropped its wing/room/life_domain
  tags, so it silently vanished from any domain-scoped ("wing=…") recall. Recovery
  now restores those fields. Separately, keyword-only memories were being scored as
  if created just now (maximum freshness), letting old notes outrank genuinely recent
  ones; they now use their real creation time.

- **A failed re-embed no longer leaves a memory in a permanent limbo state, and
  recovered memories keep their project_type recall filter.** When the embedding
  provider gave up on a memory, its status was left saying "still queued" forever —
  a stale marker that could trigger doomed writes to the vector store for a memory
  that has no vector. Failed embeds are now recorded truthfully, and a
  recovery pass heals any already-stranded rows — restoring the ones that did
  embed and marking the ones that truly failed. Deleting a memory now also clears
  its entity mentions. Memories re-embedded after an outage also keep their `project_type`
  so they stay visible in project-scoped recall.

- **Storing a memory no longer briefly stalls other work while it talks to the
  vector store.** The store, supersede, and delete paths made blocking vector-store
  HTTP calls directly on the event loop, so a slow round-trip could momentarily
  freeze concurrent Telegram, dashboard, and reflection activity. Those calls now
  run off-thread (matching the background paths), keeping the system responsive
  under load.

- **Telegram no longer drops messages or breaks approval buttons when the
  legacy bridge gets started alongside the server.** Two Genesis processes
  polling the same bot token split incoming updates between them (observed:
  thousands of `Conflict` errors, unresponsive approval buttons, and a
  corrupted health-status file monitored by the watchdog). The bridge now
  yields cleanly at startup whenever the server is running — however it was
  started (deploy script habit, manual, self-heal) — and the server calls out
  a rogue bridge loudly instead of failing silently. The broken self-heal
  rule that restarted the bridge on a stale awareness heartbeat (a leftover
  from when the bridge owned the awareness loop) is gone; a health alert
  takes its place, and server restarts for genuinely dead schedulers remain
  with the external watchdog.

- **Quiet hours no longer restart the Telegram poller.** The stall detector
  only counted arriving messages as signs of life, so any 15+ minutes of
  silence looked like a hung poller and triggered an updater restart, all day
  long. Successful empty polls now count as liveness; real network hangs
  still trigger the restart.

- **Protected-path guarding now covers the real systemd unit sources.** The
  critical-path rules protected a stale copy of the watchdog unit under
  `config/` while leaving `scripts/systemd/*.template` — the files installs
  actually render live units from — editable from relay channels. The rules
  now protect all unit templates, and the unused `config/genesis-watchdog.*`
  duplicates (stale 60s cadence, wrong dependencies) are removed.

- **The dashboard stops lying about monitoring state — six correctness fixes.**
  The Observations badge no longer reads 0 on a fresh page load while unsurfaced
  observations are waiting (its count now loads with the page and refreshes on
  the standard poll). The Event Log defaults to INFO+ so the once-a-minute
  heartbeat no longer drowns the feed (DEBUG stays one click away). The Neural
  Monitor shows long-stale runs as days ("67d") instead of raw hours
  ("1613.5h"). The Error Log's time-range column shows the date on both ends
  when a group spans days. The observation source filter folds per-session
  UUIDs into a single "session (any)" option. And high-traffic tabs show
  "Loading…" during their first fetch instead of flashing a false "No X found".

- **The Guardian's recovery brain no longer goes dark when its work directory is
  misconfigured.** On some installs the Guardian's configured CC work dir points
  at a path it can't create (e.g. a root-owned dir on an install that predates
  the setup script) — which used to make its intelligent diagnosis fail mid-
  incident and silently drop it to alert-only. It now falls back to a writable
  state dir so the self-healing path keeps working.

- **Knowledge-base results no longer go missing from DRIFT memory recall's
  keyword arm.** The wing-scoped keyword (FTS) search inside the DRIFT
  fallback pipeline only ever looked at episodic memories, so a recall that
  included knowledge sources could only surface knowledge via vector
  similarity — exact-phrase and keyword matches on ingested docs were
  silently dropped. It now searches every requested collection.

- **Background sessions that crash or get cancelled no longer show up as
  "completed."** A session interrupted mid-run used to sit "active" until a
  cleanup job quietly relabeled it completed — so the dashboard and
  Genesis's own success metrics counted crashes as wins. Cancelled sessions
  are now recorded as failed on the spot, orphaned ones are marked expired
  (outcome unknown) at boot and every 6 hours, and only genuinely finished
  sessions read as completed.

- **Asking Genesis to grow a disk or wait on your reply now works from a Claude
  Code session, not only from inside the running server.** The two tools that
  block on your Telegram reply (`provision_grow`, `outreach_send_and_wait`) need
  the live message pipeline, which runs in the Genesis server — not in the
  separate helper process a CC session talks to. They used to fail there with
  "pipeline not initialized"; they now hand the request to the server so an
  approval-and-wait, or an approval-gated grow, can be driven from a session.

- **The Guardian no longer false-alarms that the host gateway is "stale" after a
  healthy update — and can no longer roll it back.** A guardian redeploy advances
  the host's deployed code without moving its install-dir git checkout, so the
  staleness check (which compared against that lagging checkout) fired a spurious
  "gateway stale" alert after every clean update, and its self-heal could copy the
  *older* checked-out gateway over the current one. The check now measures against
  the commit that was actually deployed, so a healthy update stays quiet while a
  genuinely frozen gateway is still detected and repaired.

- **Memory recall no longer surfaces Genesis's own internal noise.** Machine-generated
  decisional output — background reflections, autonomy task retrospectives, and ego-dispatch
  records — was leaking into normal recall because several writers didn't mark themselves as
  internal-subsystem writes. Those writers are now tagged, so the content stays available to the
  subsystem that produced it but no longer pollutes user-facing recall (which measurably improves
  results on reflection-adjacent queries). Existing installs can purge already-embedded legacy
  noise with the new `scripts/backfill_source_subsystem.py`, then
  `scripts/cleanup_subsystem_qdrant.py` — both dry-run by default; add `--apply` to commit.

- **A dead provider kept reporting itself recovered, so a multi-day outage was
  recorded as a series of short incidents that each "recovered".** The
  `/v1/models` health probe healed a circuit breaker whenever the model was still
  *listed* by the provider — but a model can be listed and not callable. When an
  account loses entitlement to a model, the listing endpoint keeps answering 200
  while every real call returns 403, which is exactly the shape the probe read as
  "recovered". Closing the breaker fired the recovery hook, which resolved the
  `provider_failure` record and cleared the only per-provider "failing since"
  timestamp Genesis keeps; the next real call failed again and the cycle
  restarted, so the outage clock never accumulated and no surface could report a
  duration. Measured over one real multi-day outage: eight separate failure
  records, every one of them closed automatically while the provider was in fact
  answering nothing at all. The rule now is symmetry: a health probe may undo
  a health probe's own suspicion, and nothing else. If real calls broke a
  provider, a real call has to prove it fixed.

  This does not take a provider out of rotation. A tripped provider is
  automatically put back on probation once its backoff window passes, and a
  provider on probation is still called — so the next real request to it *is*
  the retry, and a success clears it. What changed is only that Genesis no
  longer announces a recovery it has not actually seen.

  **What this changes for you:** a provider that is genuinely dead is now retried
  progressively less often instead of every couple of minutes, settling at once
  every 30 minutes — or once every 4 hours when the failure looks like an
  exhausted quota. That is the point for a dead provider, but it also means a
  provider whose quota resets can wait up to 4 hours before Genesis tries it
  again, using the next provider in the chain until then. Reading the retry delay
  the provider itself reports is the exact fix and is tracked as follow-up work.

- **Disabling a provider from the dashboard now holds against health checks,
  and re-enabling one actually clears it.** The toggle used to reach into the
  breaker and set its fields directly, which left the new "who broke this"
  record out of step in both directions: a provider switched off by hand could
  be quietly switched back on by a routine health check, and a provider
  switched back on kept a stale "real calls failed here" mark that made it
  refuse to go green again until real traffic arrived. Both transitions are now
  operations the breaker performs on itself, so the state and the reason for it
  are set together, with a test that scans for code setting breaker state from
  outside. (A disabled provider still returns to rotation when its
  backoff window elapses — that is separate, and tracked.)

- **Removed a provider toggle that could never work.** The Tool Providers card
  on the Overview tab carried disable/enable buttons that posted the tool
  provider's name to an endpoint which only knows routing-provider names. The
  two are different namespaces, so every click returned "not found" and popped
  an error. The working toggle is on the Internals tab and is unaffected.

- **Upgrading in the middle of an outage no longer forgets that the outage is
  real.** The saved breaker file written by the previous version has no record
  of what broke a provider, and reading that silence as "a health check did it"
  would have let the first health check after the upgrade close a breaker that
  real calls had opened — losing the outage exactly once, at the worst moment.
  A saved-as-failing provider with no recorded cause is now treated as broken by
  real calls, which is the only thing it can have been.

- **Alerts now say how long they have been firing.** `alert_events` has recorded
  `created_at` for every open alert with 90-day retention since it was
  introduced, and nothing read it — so a condition three days old was rendered
  identically to one three minutes old. Alert messages now carry
  `(ongoing for 3d 4h)` once an alert has been continuously open for more than an
  hour. Enriching the message rather than adding a widget means every surface
  that renders an alert message gains the duration at once — the dashboard
  banner, the morning report and the outreach path. Note the existing filters
  still apply: the morning report omits call-site warnings and the Telegram path
  carries only whitelisted critical alerts, so for a degraded call site the
  duration appears on the dashboard. Self-isolating: a failure to compute the
  duration costs the suffix, never the alert.

- **The dashboard could not display a tripped circuit breaker at all.** The
  routing API emits breaker state from a lowercase-valued enum, while four
  frontend comparisons tested against an uppercase literal — a comparison that is
  never true. The provider dot rendered green, the toggle button read "disable",
  and the Provider Keys indicator stayed green regardless of the real state, with
  the "circuit breaker open" tooltip unreachable. All four now route through a
  single case-insensitive helper, and a guard test scans the frontend directories
  so a new file cannot reintroduce the comparison.

- **The dashboard now tells "broken" apart from "not proven working yet."** A
  provider is shown three ways instead of two: red when real calls are failing
  and it is not being used, hollow amber when it is still in rotation but has
  not completed a call since its last trouble, and green when it is healthy.
  Hovering says which, and why — real calls failed, or only a health check
  could not reach it. Previously a provider awaiting its next call looked
  identical to one actively failing, which overstated the problem; that state
  is now common enough to be worth naming, since recovery waits for a real call.

- **Alert severity dots were always amber, including for critical alerts.** The
  colour map was keyed lowercase while severities are emitted uppercase, so every
  lookup missed and fell through to the warning colour. The map now normalises
  case, covers the full emitted vocabulary, and gives an unrecognised severity its
  own colour instead of silently painting it as a warning.

- **Grouped error severity was ranked alphabetically, which inverts it.** The
  severity vocabulary is lowercase, so a plain `MAX()` orders
  `warning > info > error > debug > critical` — critical sorts lowest. Any group
  mixing a critical with a warning reported "warning" and rendered amber,
  silently downgrading the most severe events in the group. Ranking is now
  explicit.

### Security

- **Invisible-character stripping now covers every invisible Unicode format
  character, not a hand-picked 13 of them.** Campaign names and awareness-signal
  text are normalized before they reach a line-parsed prompt, to stop injected text
  forging or concealing a line. That normalizer enumerated 13 of Unicode's 170 `Cf`
  format characters, silently omitting concealment characters from the very families
  it did cover — most pointedly U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARK, sibling of the
  already-stripped LRM/RLM, plus SOFT HYPHEN, WORD JOINER and the invisible U+E0000
  tag block. The set is now derived from Python's Unicode database by an explicit
  rule (strip a format character only when it is genuinely invisible — zero-width,
  a bidi override, an invisible direction mark, or an annotation control), with a
  test that regenerates it and fails if the two ever diverge.

  Format characters that are *visible* content are deliberately preserved, so the
  wider net does not corrupt real text: the Arabic number and end-of-ayah signs,
  Syriac abbreviation mark, Kaithi number signs and Egyptian hieroglyph joiners all
  pass through, as do zero-width joiner and non-joiner — stripping those would break
  every emoji sequence (👨‍👩‍👧 → three separate people) and change Persian and Indic
  words, where the non-joiner is orthographically required.

- **A campaign name made only of invisible characters is now rejected instead of
  being created with an empty name.**

- **A malformed Claude Code session id can no longer create directories outside
  the session tree.** Hooks store per-session state under
  `~/.genesis/sessions/<session-id>/`, interpolating the id straight into the
  path — and two sites create the directory. An id containing `/` or `..` therefore
  escaped that tree, and the guard against it had been hand-copied into some hooks
  in three different shapes while being omitted from eight call sites across four
  files. The path-building sites now go through one shared helper
  (`hook_input.session_path`), which returns nothing for an unsafe id so the caller
  skips exactly the filesystem operation and nothing else; a site that needs only
  the yes/no answer calls the shared validator directly. Normal sessions are
  unaffected. This is the hook contract, not a repo-wide one: several other hooks
  and a number of paths under `src/` still carry their own hand-written check —
  including one file this change otherwise touches — and consolidating those is
  separate work. An id that fails the check falls back to
  the shared `unknown` key — itself a directory, so such sessions share one bucket
  rather than escaping the tree.

- **A leading shell redirect can no longer slip the push/commit approval gates.**
  The shared command parser now recognizes shell redirections (`2>/dev/null`,
  `> out.log`, `2>&1`, `&>log`, `>| f`, `< in`, `<<<`) and consumes the operator
  and its target instead of leaking them into the parsed argv. Previously a
  *leading* redirect (`git 2>/dev/null push --force`, `git 2>&1 commit --no-verify`)
  made the parser read the redirect token as the git subcommand, so the push and
  commit gates never recognized the command and skipped their approval checks. The
  redirect target is measured as one complete shell word, so an escaped or
  concatenated-quote space inside it (`git 2>err\ log push`,
  `git 2>pre"a b"post push`) no longer hides the subcommand either. As
  a bonus, a targeted local `pytest` run that redirects output
  (`pytest tests/x.py 2>&1`) is no longer misclassified as a whole-suite run.

- **Observation content can no longer launder untrusted origin into privileged
  cognitive surfaces.** Observation rows now carry a definite origin stamped at the
  write boundary: the CRUD chokepoint classifies every writer (explicit origin →
  dispatching-session origin → source classification → NULL fail-closed), so an
  unknown/novel writer's rows degrade to excluded rather than silently trusted.
  Owner-attended `task_detected` writes stamp `owner`; gateway ones stamp
  `external_untrusted`. The two stdlib-only hook writers that bypass the CRUD layer
  (the conversation-pivot writer and the post-commit audit writer) stamp origin
  inline, and a one-time migration backfills historical rows. On the read side, the
  laundering-critical surfaces — the always-loaded essential-knowledge file and the
  deep-reflection / perception prompt pipeline — now exclude external/unknown-origin
  content (fail-closed; unknown-origin excluded), severing the path by which external
  content could reach reflection and re-enter the user model as a trusted delta. A
  coverage guardrail fails CI on any new raw observation-insert that bypasses the
  origin chokepoint. The pushed-surfaces supervision exemption for interactive
  sessions is now restricted to owner-attended channels (terminal/Telegram); gateway
  conversations no longer receive it. Gateway and voice conversation sessions carry
  a durable `external_untrusted` session origin so a reflection overlapping them
  cannot launder its user-model delta to first-party, and the learning triage
  pipeline stamps its per-session `retrospective`/`cc_debrief` observations with the
  analyzed conversation's channel origin (an inbox/mail session's learnings can no
  longer surface as first-party). The coverage guardrail now also follows the
  indirect `ObservationWriter` writer and module-constant sources. On Telegram
  quote-replies, slash-command and task intent are parsed from the owner's own reply
  only — a `/task` (or `/model`, `/effort`, `/resume`) embedded in quoted bot text
  can no longer forge an owner-authorized command.

- **Untrusted content can no longer poison your user model or trigger autonomy.**
  Background sessions that process external material (e.g. the inbox evaluator over
  the links you drop in) now write observations stamped with their true origin, and
  the pipelines that would auto-apply an observation into privileged state — your
  learned user model, and autonomous task dispatch — refuse any update whose origin
  isn't first-party. A crafted item can no longer smuggle a high-confidence "fact
  about you" into Genesis's self-model or spawn a task. Refused updates are held
  (not discarded) and logged, and normal reflection-authored updates are unaffected.

- **The dashboard API is now hardened against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).**
  With a password set, a state-changing API call authenticated by your login
  cookie must now originate from the dashboard itself (verified via the browser's
  `Sec-Fetch-Site`/`Origin` headers). Previously another page — including a
  separate service sharing your dashboard's host — could ride your logged-in
  session to trigger dashboard actions; that path is now refused. Genesis's own
  components (which use an internal token) and read-only calls are unaffected, and
  the same `GENESIS_DASHBOARD_API_AUTH=off` switch disables this along with the
  rest of the gate.

### Removed

- **The duplicate-session guard is gone — it fought the wrong enemy.** The
  guard (July 14) keyed "who owns this conversation" on process liveness, but
  a slot session lives for days and serves many conversations, so reopening
  any conversation in a different slot manufactured a phantom "duplicate
  executor" — denying legitimate work and paging critical alerts for
  incidents that weren't happening. With every door now attach-or-create
  (above), the accidental-twin scenario the guard existed for can no longer
  occur; deliberately resuming one conversation in two terminals at once is
  allowed and left to your judgment. Removed: the PreToolUse deny hook, the
  session-owner registry (leftover `~/.genesis/session-owners` data is
  cleaned up on next bootstrap), the session-start warning, and the paging
  check. The fast dead-SSH-client detection (sshd ClientAlive) stays — it
  makes dropped connections detach cleanly.

## [v3.0b17] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **The voice dashboard's Bridge tab is now a full cockpit.** Instead of a bare status line, it
  shows the ambient edge bridge's complete live health, grouped for scanning: memory leak-watch
  (parent / diarization-child / total RSS, ORT-arena state, pool recycles), capture activity
  (utterances, rows per hour, last-utterance age), diarization worker state, connection
  stability (connects, dark events, gap durations), and speaker-ID status — read on demand from
  the edge via the new `GET /api/genesis/voice/bridge` endpoint. Any new health field the edge
  starts reporting surfaces automatically under "Other."

- **Voice dashboard Device tab: live Voice PE hardware vitals.** Temperature, WiFi signal,
  uptime, reset reason, free heap, loop time, and voice-pipeline status, polled from Home
  Assistant on demand (`GET /api/genesis/voice/device`; set `HA_VOICE_PE_PREFIX`). *(Shipped
  earlier in #876; the changelog entry was missed at the time.)*

- **The Genesis Voice add-on's attention surface now shows the judge's reasoning — and lets you review it.**
  For the optional passive-listening add-on, the buried "Attention" tab is now a top-level **Genesis Voice →
  Judgment** review. Each moment the attention gate noticed is scored by a lightweight LLM judge that says
  whether it was real speech, whether it was worth attention, and — new — a one-word category and a short
  reason. You review the judge (worth noticing / not worth it / skip) and can jot your own *why*; your notes
  inform the judge's prompt, not any hidden weights. It stays offline observability — nothing here speaks or
  acts, and it's hidden entirely when the voice add-on isn't installed.

- **Attention events now record which device they came from, and the Judgment tab can filter by it.**
  Every "perk-up" event the passive-listening engine emits now carries the source device (the home
  edge connection, or `omi` once the wearable connector lands), and the dashboard's Judgment review
  gains a device dropdown plus a per-event source pill — so you can review one device's moments in
  isolation. The engine also stops penalizing text-only sources: an utterance with no audio capture
  (no loudness to measure) is scored on its text signals instead of being docked 25% clarity or
  dropped as near-silence junk, which is what OMI wearable transcripts will need.

- **The dashboard's container-health badge now tells the truth about CPU and memory pressure.**
  Previously the badge ignored CPU entirely (it was hardwired to "healthy") and judged memory only by a
  raw usage figure that's inflated by reclaimable cache — so a busy or memory-throttling box could still
  read all-green. It now factors in actual CPU utilization and PSI (pressure-stall) readings: it stays
  green when the box is merely holding reclaimable cache, and only turns amber/red when CPU or memory is
  genuinely stalling work, with a reason that says which.

- **The dashboard now shows the memory each Claude Code session is using, and warns you if one balloons.**
  Each concurrent session normally uses well under a gigabyte; the Container card now lists per-session RSS, and
  if a single session climbs past a high ceiling — a sign it may be leaking — Genesis raises a health alert
  (reaching Telegram at the critical level) so you can restart just that session instead of finding out the hard way.

- **Ambient bridge memory-leak regression alert.** If the edge bridge's RSS ever climbs past the
  healthy plateau again (total > 1000 MB or diarization child > 450 MB), ambient health flips to
  degraded and you get a one-time Telegram alert naming the breach — no nagging, and normal
  workload bursts never trigger it. Requires an ambient edge reporting the `rss_*` health keys.

- **The dashboard now has a Campaigns tab where you can see and control your autonomous campaigns.**
  Each campaign shows its status, schedule (with next fire time), model/effort, today's spend
  against its daily cap, completed runs vs. attempts, and whether a session is currently in
  flight — plus recent run history and live state. You can pause/resume a campaign, run one
  immediately, and edit its cadence, model, effort, daily cost cap, and a new optional
  schedule "jitter" (randomized fire times so ticks aren't perfectly periodic). Until now the
  only way to see or steer a campaign was through Genesis directly.

- **Genesis now stewards its own open-source pull requests instead of filing-and-forgetting.**
  A new background campaign checks the upstream PRs Genesis has authored (e.g. to litellm,
  Qwen-Agent) every couple of days, and acts on what changed: it nudges a stalled PR once,
  pings you when a maintainer responds or merges, and closes PRs that have gone unanswered
  past a grace window — so contributions don't quietly die of inactivity. It runs in a new
  locked-down session profile whose shell is restricted to the `gh` CLI only; any code
  changes a reviewer asks for are escalated to you rather than pushed automatically.

- **You can now run Genesis on Claude Fable 5, and pick the full thinking-effort range on Sonnet and Fable.**
  Fable 5 (Anthropic's new top-tier model) is now a selectable model everywhere you choose one — the ego,
  campaigns, the inbox monitor, the Telegram default, the `/model` command (terminal and Telegram), and the
  dashboard dropdowns. Sonnet (now Sonnet 5) and Fable also accept the full `low`–`max` effort range,
  including `xhigh` and `max`; previously Sonnet was capped at `high`. Nothing switches automatically — your
  existing defaults are unchanged; this only makes the new options available when you want them.

- **You can now start an interactive Claude Code session on a different model with one command.**
  `gmodel <name>` launches `claude` on the model you pick: a Claude tier (`gmodel opus`) runs on
  your normal Max subscription, while a roster peer (`gmodel glm-5.2`) runs on that provider's
  native endpoint and its own API key. Plain `claude` is untouched. `gmodel` on its own lists the
  models and which have keys configured; `gmodel --print-env <name>` shows what it would do without
  launching. Your Anthropic subscription is protected — the launcher never lets a stray API key
  quietly switch you to per-token billing, and never sends your Anthropic key to a third-party
  endpoint. (Switch models by relaunching; each session is pinned to one model.)

- **You can now put a model through a "gauntlet" to prove it can actually drive Claude Code
  before you rely on it.** `genesis eval gauntlet --model <name>` has the model (native Claude,
  or a routed roster peer like GLM) fix real broken Python projects inside a live Claude Code
  session, then scores it objectively by running the project's tests — and catches cheating
  (editing the tests or pytest config to fake a pass). Results are recorded so quality can be
  tracked over time. An optional weekly run (off by default, opt-in via the roster's
  `gauntlet.scheduled`) re-checks each roster model and, if one that used to pass starts
  failing, alerts you and files a proposal for your review — it never silently drops a model
  from failover on its own.

- **Your morning report now shows Genesis's weekly cognitive-quality grades.** Each week
  Genesis grades its own subsystems (memory, ego, procedural, awareness, reflection) A–F;
  the morning report now surfaces them, so cognitive health is visible at a glance instead
  of buried in a dashboard. Healthy grades compress to a single "nominal" line — it only
  elaborates on a subsystem that's low.

- **Genesis now tells you when its own cognitive quality regresses — and proposes a fix.**
  When a subsystem's weekly grade drops to F or falls sharply from the week before, Genesis
  sends you an alert and files a dashboard proposal to investigate (for example, running an
  experiment on the affected subsystem). Nothing changes automatically — it's a heads-up plus
  a recommendation you approve or dismiss.

- **Genesis can now propose improvements to how it reflects — and apply them only with your approval.**
  The Evo loop measures variations of the deep-reflection prompt against a golden set
  (with held-out re-validation), and when one is a confirmed improvement it files a
  proposal on the dashboard. Approving it updates the live reflection prompt; the change
  is fully reversible (one click rolls it back). Nothing is ever applied automatically —
  Genesis recommends, you decide.

- **Three session skills now ship with the repo: `/shelve`, `/unshelve`, and `genesis-voice`.** `/shelve`
  bookmarks the current session with tags and a context note; `/unshelve` finds bookmarked sessions later by
  keyword and gives you the resume command. `genesis-voice` is the style guide Genesis applies when it writes
  as itself (outreach, community posts, DMs) — first person, prove-don't-claim, with a mandatory anti-slop
  pass anchored to the voice-master audit. Previously these existed only as untracked files on the
  development install.

- **Genesis now measures how often its automatic memory surfacing repeats itself within a session.**
  Each prompt's surfaced memories are tracked per session, and the health snapshot's proactive-memory
  section gains an `overlap_7d` rollup — the share of surfaced memories over the last 7 days that had
  already been shown earlier in the same session. Measurement only: what gets surfaced is unchanged.
  This data decides whether a planned improvement ships (skipping re-injection of memories already in
  context to free slots for novel ones).

- **Genesis can now shelve "someday/maybe" ideas separately from its actionable to-do list.**
  Until now, every deferred item a session or the ego created landed in the actionable follow-up
  queue — even low-value "might be worth doing someday" ideas — so the queue filled with things
  nobody intended to act on. Genesis can now file those into a separate "tabled" lane instead
  (the dashboard Follow-ups tab already supported this; now Genesis's own sessions and ego can too,
  and can move an existing item between the two lanes). Tabled items are tracked but never surfaced
  as work or auto-actioned, keeping the actionable list focused on real commitments.

- **Genesis now catches scheduled jobs that silently stop working — running on schedule but never
  succeeding.** Some background jobs (like the weekly self-assessment and quality calibration) could
  fail week after week without ever showing up as "failed," because the failure counter is reset
  every time the server restarts. Genesis now watches the gap between a job's last run and its last
  success: if a job has been running-but-not-succeeding for more than about a week, it raises a health
  alert that reaches your daily report and the dashboard, and the job-health view now shows a
  `days_since_success` figure and a `stale` flag for every job.

- **Genesis now notices when its Claude Code subscription hits its usage cap — instead of quietly going dark.**
  A capped Anthropic subscription makes `claude -p` return *empty* output with no error, which Genesis used to
  record as a successful (but blank) run — so its background thinking (ego cycles, reflections, weekly reviews)
  could silently produce nothing for days without anyone noticing. Genesis now watches for a run of empty
  results on calls that should have produced output and, when it sees one, sends a single critical alert
  ("CC subscription likely capped — degraded until the limit resets") so you know to check. It's detection only:
  it never changes how a call runs, and it stays quiet during normal idle periods.

- **Off-site backups now self-prune on a grandfather-father-son schedule instead of growing forever.**
  When you back up to an off-site target (NAS/SMB or a mounted path), each run now prunes old dated
  snapshots — keeping the last 7 daily, 4 weekly, and 6 monthly — so remote storage stays bounded. It
  never deletes the most recent complete snapshot (the one a restore uses), never touches an
  in-progress snapshot, and never affects your local keep-forever transcript archive.

- **Daily disk hygiene now prunes stale scratch and old attention snapshots.** Housekeeping now
  age-prunes leftover files in `~/tmp` (older than 7 days) and garbage-collects attention-engine
  snapshots older than 60 days — but never one behind a moment you've labeled for review, so your
  labeled history stays revealable. Keeps disk usage from creeping up between the reactive cleanups
  that previously only fired when the disk was nearly full.

- **Genesis now keeps its own disk clean automatically, so it won't quietly fill up and stall.**
  A daily hygiene job reaps git worktrees whose branches have already merged (moving them to a
  7-day recovery trash bin, never deleting work in progress) and clears regenerable caches that
  otherwise creep up over time. If the disk still climbs toward full, Genesis clears the heavier
  reindexable caches automatically at 90% — before the disk hits 100% and disrupts the server,
  its write-ahead log, or backups. Previously the worktree cleanup existed but was never
  scheduled, so it never actually ran.

- **The Sentinel now learns which infrastructure fixes would be safe to run itself — observe-only.**
  Every fix the Sentinel proposes still requires your approval, exactly as before. What's new: each
  proposed action is additionally classified as "would run autonomously" (reversible, programmatic,
  and matching a conservative allowlist of known-safe command shapes — service restarts, journal
  vacuums, cache drops) or "would still ask you" (anything permanent, data-mutating, unlisted, or
  that could take down the Sentinel's own host process), and the verdict is logged to
  `sentinel_log.jsonl`. This shadow data calibrates a future opt-in autonomous tier against real
  incidents before it is ever allowed to act. The mode lives in `config/sentinel.yaml`
  (`autonomy.mode: shadow`); `live` is reserved and not yet implemented — nothing executes without
  approval regardless of the setting.

- **Genesis now re-hardens its own host SSH key automatically — no human on the host required.** The
  Guardian's control key (the one the container uses to manage the host) is supposed to carry `no-pty`
  and a source-IP `from=` restriction, but before this those were applied only at install time, so an
  install set up before the hardening — or one whose container address changed — kept a weaker key
  until someone re-ran the installer by hand. The watchdog now checks the key's hardening every cycle
  and, when it has drifted, calls a new `reharden-key` gateway operation that rewrites the key to the
  hardened form and proves the rewrite still works before committing to it (a built-in 120-second
  dead-man's-switch restores the previous key otherwise, so it can never lock Genesis out of its own
  host). A moved-but-stable source address heals on its own; a flapping address is left alone and
  reported instead of chased. For the rare manual case, `install_guardian.sh --reharden-key-only`
  re-hardens the key without a full re-install.

- **The Guardian now maintains a rolling "healthy" snapshot of the container — the restore point its
  snapshot-rollback recovery always needed.** Once a day, while every health check passes, the Guardian
  takes a `-healthy` container snapshot and deletes the previous one (exactly one exists, never more
  than a day old, so copy-on-write growth can't quietly fill the storage pool the way stale snapshots
  once did). Snapshot rollback — the one recovery action that works even with the network down — now
  has a real target; before this, nothing ever created a healthy snapshot, so rollback could never
  succeed. Kill switch: `snapshots.healthy_enabled: false` in `guardian.yaml`.

- **The Genesis container now comes back on its own after a host reboot — including an unclean one.**
  `host-setup.sh` sets incus `boot.autostart` on the container (applied to existing installs on
  re-run, not just fresh ones). Previously an unclean host reboot could leave the container stopped
  indefinitely, taking Genesis and its network access down until someone noticed.

### Changed

- **The idle-time code auditor now hunts the failure modes AI-generated code actually has.** Its
  briefing gained a research-backed taxonomy — swallowed async errors, orphan state without
  teardown, race surfaces, phantom guards, near-duplicate helpers, cosmetic abstractions, pattern
  abandonment, and constraints quietly removed during refinement cycles — so audit findings target
  the defect classes iterative LLM development is known to produce instead of only generic lint
  categories. Development guidance gained the matching discipline: iterate with scoped explicit
  prompts (never "improve this"), and diff refinements for what they *removed*.

- **The Sentinel (Genesis's internal emergency responder) now only wakes for problems it can
  actually fix.** Previously any CRITICAL health alert woke it — including things it has no way to
  remediate, like backups failing to reach a remote repo, a provider running out of credits, or an
  external API outage. Those now stay visible on the dashboard and still notify you directly (backup
  failures were added to the immediate-notification list), but they no longer trigger an automated
  diagnostic session that can only conclude "nothing I can do." Each alert is matched against the
  remediation tools available on your install, so e.g. a Guardian alarm only wakes the Sentinel where
  a Guardian is actually configured. Installs that intentionally don't run backups no longer see a
  false "backup failed" critical alert at all.

- **When the Sentinel does wake, it now launches knowing exactly what it can act on.** Its diagnostic
  session is handed the live list of remediation tools available on your install and told which one
  applies to each firing alarm, so its proposed fixes stay grounded in what's actually possible here
  — and it escalates with its diagnosis instead of inventing a command when nothing available can fix
  the problem. It also launches with a short orientation to your system's shape and pointers to the
  architecture docs it can consult.

- **A rejected Sentinel approval can no longer freeze the Sentinel.** If you rejected (or let
  expire) a Sentinel dispatch approval while the underlying alarm stayed active, the Sentinel parked
  itself waiting forever and silently ignored every new alarm. It now applies your decision on the
  next check: a rejection suppresses that alarm pattern for 24h and returns the Sentinel to healthy,
  ready for the next real emergency. Sentinel state changes also now appear in the event log under
  their own "sentinel" subsystem, so a parked or wedged state is visible instead of silent.

- **The dashboard loads faster and shows consistent status/time formats.** The web UI's
  scripts and styles moved out of the page into cacheable files, so after your first visit
  only data — not the whole 700KB page — is re-fetched. Overview health chips now use one
  consistent 5-state color system with shape glyphs (● ▲ ✕ ◔ ○) so state is readable
  without color, and ages render in one format everywhere ("just now" / 5m / 3h / 2d)
  instead of mixed styles.

- **The dashboard Infrastructure card now labels the ambient-capture bridge as "Voice Bridge"** —
  a clearer, user-facing name. It still only appears when a voice/ambient edge is configured.

- **The procedures Genesis learns are now concrete, replayable playbooks instead of vague
  summaries.** Previously every learned procedure was written as a "what this teaches: …"
  summary, and the learner only saw a heavily-truncated view of what happened (each tool's
  arguments cut to 80 characters), so the real commands, paths, and flags were lost. Now the
  learner reconstructs the actual step-by-step playbook — with the real commands used — for a
  specific recurring scenario, and skips things that aren't procedures (general best-practices,
  engineering patterns, one-off events, broad workflows; those belong in skills/CLAUDE.md). The
  result is a smaller, higher-signal procedure store.

- **Genesis now learns several distinct playbooks from one session, and stops storing duplicates.**
  A session that accomplished several different things now yields a separate playbook for each
  (instead of one muddled procedure), and a genuinely reusable sub-step can be captured on its own.
  At the same time, before saving a new procedure Genesis checks whether it already knows
  essentially the same one — even if it would be filed under a different name — and skips the
  duplicate. Together these keep the procedure store both more complete and less cluttered.

- **Genesis surfaces its learned procedures by relevance — now including unproven
  drafts, carefully.** A procedure Genesis has learned but not yet validated can be
  surfaced when it's a strong match for what you're doing, but only on a higher
  relevance bar than proven procedures and clearly flagged as an *unproven draft —
  suggestion, not authoritative*. This lets a genuinely useful draft help (and earn
  its way to proven status through use) instead of sitting unused forever, without
  ever presenting it as settled guidance. Blind session-start injection still stays
  limited to the most-proven, always-on procedures. Genesis also now repairs
  procedures that were missing their embedding, so they stop being silently
  invisible to this relevance matching. Genesis also now counts each time a
  procedure is surfaced into context this way, so its own self-learning health
  check reports learned procedures honestly as *reaching* its attention rather
  than falsely flagging them as lost — and this surfacing count is kept strictly
  separate from the signals that promote a procedure, so merely showing a draft
  can never inflate its standing.

- **Procedures you actually use now earn their keep.** How often a learned
  procedure is recalled ("reads") now counts as a dampened usefulness signal:
  frequently-recalled procedures rank higher when surfaced, and can be promoted
  to higher activation tiers (reads alone can reach passive surfacing; the
  proactive advisory tier still requires a real success). A procedure also now
  graduates from speculative to validated on its first real success — previously
  nothing ever cleared that flag.

### Fixed

- **A false "deferred work backlog" health warning no longer fires every few minutes.** The
  weekly memory dream-cycle parks a large synthesis worklist that drains a little each day by
  design; the health check was counting that scheduled batch against the "postponed due to
  degradation" queue alarm, so it tripped a WARNING on every awareness tick. The alarm now
  watches only genuine recovery backlog (a stalled worklist still surfaces after a full drain
  cycle), and the dashboard shows the batch worklist separately from recovery work.

- **The dashboard's Infrastructure card is clearer at a glance: failed probes sort to the top, and a
  stray raw row is gone.** Probes now order worst-first (down/error, then degraded, then healthy) so
  problems surface at the top of the card instead of wherever they happened to fall in insertion
  order. The "Claude Code Sessions" data no longer also leaks out as a raw, unlabeled `cc_slots` row
  — it appears only in its dedicated section. And when an infrastructure probe crosses the
  healthy↔unhealthy line (e.g. Qdrant goes down, then recovers), that transition is now recorded in
  the Activity feed — with startup-grace and flap dampening so a restart blip or a rapidly-bouncing
  probe won't spam it.

- **The dashboard's per-session memory row is clearer: "Claude Code Sessions", green when healthy.** The
  cryptic "CC" row that listed sessions as gray "cc-1 …" chips is now labeled **Claude Code Sessions**,
  renders each healthy session in green (amber ≥ 4 GB, red ≥ 6 GB), and shows a hover tooltip explaining
  it's per-session memory for leak detection — so "gray" no longer reads as inactive/unknown.

- **The dashboard's system-health view stays responsive under load and no longer errors out when a single
  check hiccups.** Building the health snapshot used to run its systemd service checks (several `systemctl`
  calls) and a couple of file scans directly on the main event loop, so gathering health could briefly stall
  other work; and if any one sub-check raised an unexpected error, the entire health request failed. Those
  checks now run off the main loop, and a failure in one section degrades just that section to an error state
  while the rest of the health view loads normally. Overlapping health requests now also share a single
  computation instead of each recomputing from scratch.

- **The dead-letter-queue alert no longer cries wolf on self-healing bursts.** A short burst of low-value
  retry items (e.g. memory-relevance grades, which are discarded within an hour by design) could push the queue
  past its alert threshold and fire a *critical* notification for something that clears itself minutes later.
  The alert now counts only items that are genuinely stuck — pending past their designed self-heal window — so a
  transient burst stays quiet while a real, un-draining backlog still alerts. The dashboard still shows the full
  raw count.

- **The dashboard now reports each ego's cycle health separately.** Genesis runs two egos (a user-facing
  one and its own), and both recorded their proactive-cycle health under a single shared key — so on the
  health surface one ego's last run kept overwriting the other's, making it impossible to tell whether
  either was actually cycling. Each ego now tracks its own health row, so a stalled or failing ego is
  visible instead of masked.

- **Automatic Qdrant restart works again.** The self-heal action that restarts a downed Qdrant
  targeted the wrong systemd manager and failed with "Access denied," leaving the vector store
  without automatic recovery. It now restarts the correct user-scoped service.

- **The emergency responder can't stall its own monitoring anymore.** If a Sentinel remediation
  session was running when a health tick fired, the tick could block behind it long enough to
  trip the very "monitoring is overdue" alarm the Sentinel exists to prevent. The tick now skips
  cleanly when a remediation is already in flight.

- **The watchdog's memory-reclaim cooldown now survives its own restarts, so it can't trigger an
  I/O storm under sustained memory pressure.** When container memory runs high, the watchdog reclaims
  a small, capped amount of page cache — throttled to at most once every 5 minutes to avoid an I/O
  spiral. That throttle lived only in memory, but the watchdog runs as a fresh short-lived process on
  each check, so it reset every run and never actually held. The cooldown is now persisted, so
  repeated reclaims stay correctly spaced even across the watchdog's process boundary.

- **The Guardian's snapshot safety gate now measures real LVM thin-pool allocation instead of the
  host root filesystem.** On LVM-backed storage, the free-space check behind "is it safe to take a
  snapshot" ran `df` against a path that lives on the host's root disk — so it could happily approve
  snapshots while the actual thin pool was nearly full (the same blindness behind the pool-exhaustion
  outage). The gate now reads the pool's own data/metadata usage and refuses at the configured high
  tiers; non-LVM backends keep the existing byte-headroom check, where `df` is correct.

- **The Guardian can now recover a container that is fully stopped.** Its container-restart recovery
  action used `incus restart`, which errors out on a stopped instance — exactly the state an unclean
  host reboot leaves behind. On restart failure it now falls back to `incus start`.

- **Taking a pre-recovery snapshot can no longer evict the healthy rollback snapshot.** The
  make-room-before-create step deleted the oldest snapshots purely by count, and at the default
  retention that meant deleting the healthy restore point right before the risky recovery action that
  might need it. The latest healthy snapshot is now exempt, mirroring the existing prune exemption.

- **Snapshot rollback now recovers when the storage driver refuses to restore a non-latest
  snapshot.** ZFS (documented) won't restore past newer snapshots; if the restore fails and newer
  guardian-created snapshots exist, they are deleted (they capture the already-broken state) and the
  restore is retried once.

- **Guardian's automated recovery now acts on the right service.** Guardian's self-healing (restart,
  journal-freshness, and crash-loop probes) and its diagnostic briefing pointed at a deprecated,
  usually-inactive background unit instead of the main Genesis service. As a result a "restart" could
  report success while healing nothing, and a genuine crash loop of the main service went undetected.
  Recovery, health probes, and diagnosis now target the main service, and a guardrail test keeps them
  from drifting back.

- **`update.sh` was silently skipping the host-VM sync (guardian redeploy + host Node/Claude Code
  pin healing).** A recent refactor re-indented the two inline Python snippets that read
  `guardian_remote.yaml`; the resulting parse error was suppressed, the host address resolved
  empty, and the entire host-side block quietly skipped on every update — guardian code stopped
  reaching the host and host pin drift went unhealed, while update history still reported the host
  as healthy. The snippets are now single-line (immune to the indentation class), an unusable
  guardian config now prints a loud warning and is recorded as a degraded subsystem, and a
  repo-wide test guards against any shell script reintroducing the indented-snippet shape.

- **The host Guardian no longer gets stranded on an old commit.** `update.sh` decided whether to
  redeploy the Guardian by looking only at what the *current* update pulled in — so on a run that
  pulled nothing, a host that was already behind stayed behind indefinitely (and it could fall
  behind whenever it had last been deployed from a commit that was later rebased away). The
  redeploy now compares the host's actually-deployed commit against the current code and reconciles
  the difference: it redeploys when Guardian-relevant code differs, converges a host on an
  unrecognized/orphaned commit back onto current, and only falls back to the old behavior when the
  host can't be reached — so a lagging host heals itself on the next update instead of drifting. If your
  machine ever accumulated a second Claude Code install (an old nvm-tree copy, a native-installer
  leftover, or an install in a directory only interactive shells can see), it could silently shadow
  the version Genesis pins — you'd see a months-old Claude Code in your terminal while Genesis
  believed everything was current, or updates would pointlessly reinstall on every run. The
  install/update scripts now enforce a single canonical copy: provable duplicates are removed (with
  clear logging), ambiguous files are only warned about, and shell aliases that shadow the real
  binary are flagged. Set `CC_SHADOW_SCAN=0` if you deliberately run multiple copies.

- **`update.sh` no longer hangs if the health watchdog restarts the server mid-update.**
  During an update Genesis stops its server to swap in new code and migrate the database. The
  background health watchdog could see it "down" and restart it right then — and the revived
  server's database lock deadlocked the update's procedure-seeding step, leaving the whole update
  stuck for as long as ~30 minutes with no error. The watchdog now defers restarts while an update
  is in progress, and the seeding step is time-bounded so a contended database fails fast instead of
  hanging silently.

- **Genesis now keeps your Claude Code CLI at the version it's tested against — automatically.**
  Previously the installer only put Claude Code in place when it was *missing*, so if you already
  had an older Claude Code, bumping the pinned version never actually upgraded you — you'd silently
  keep running the old one. Now `install.sh`, `bootstrap.sh`, and `update.sh` all install *or* align
  Claude Code to the pinned version on every run (matching it exactly, so an intentional rollback
  also applies), with no manual step. It's non-fatal: if the update can't run (e.g. no permissions),
  your update still completes and Claude Code is left as-is.

- **Updates no longer abort when a schema migration actually succeeded** — if the
  database was busy during an update (for example a background task writing at the same
  time), a migration could commit successfully yet still surface a transient "database
  is locked" error, which made the update roll the code back while the database had
  already moved forward. Updates now confirm whether the migration was truly applied
  before treating it as a failure, and give migrations more room to wait out a busy
  database.

- **Background code-intelligence indexing can no longer freeze your machine.** Creating a git
  worktree (or running install/bootstrap) could fire several full-repo indexing jobs at once —
  uncapped, each building its own multi-gigabyte code graph — saturating the container's disk-write
  limit until SSH and the dashboard stopped responding. All background indexing now goes through a
  single entrypoint that skips worktrees entirely (the live LSP covers those sessions with no index
  needed), runs at most one index per repo at a time, and caps the indexer's memory/IO/CPU so even
  a single job can't starve the system. A repo-wide test blocks any future code path from spawning
  a raw indexer again. Set `CODE_INTEL_INDEX_DISABLE=1` to opt out of background indexing entirely.

- **The codebase-memory code-intelligence server can no longer eat all your RAM.** The third-party
  `codebase-memory-mcp` binary has a known upstream memory leak (grows without bound over hours of
  use — several gigabytes per Claude Code session, enough to freeze the whole container when a few
  sessions run at once). Every instance now starts inside a hard 2 GB memory cap: when the leak hits
  the cap, only that server is killed and the session keeps working (reconnect it with `/mcp`).
  Existing installs pick the cap up automatically on their next update — the setup script now also
  detects and re-points a stale registration that would have bypassed the capped launcher. Override
  with `CODEBASE_MEMORY_MCP_MEMORY_MAX` if your machine has RAM to spare.

- **Skill suggestions now actually fire — and nested skill packs show up in the catalog.** The
  prompt-time skill nudge scored matches against the length of your prompt, so on any wordy prompt a
  genuine match was diluted below the firing threshold and suggestions near-never appeared; a single
  clear name-or-keyword match is now enough. Suggestions also no longer get crowded out by the process
  (TDD/brainstorming) nudges — each kind keeps its own slots — and library-skill suggestions now tell
  you exactly what to do (`Read <path>/SKILL.md`) instead of pointing at a command that can't load
  them. The catalog builder now looks inside container directories (skill packs like `gitnexus/` or
  plugin repos in the skill library), indexing the real skills inside instead of one useless entry for
  the folder. And a stale catalog can no longer cut the nudge off entirely: regeneration now runs in
  the background while the current prompt uses the existing catalog.

- **Reflection summaries are no longer degraded to raw JSON dumps when the model wraps its output in a
  code fence.** Light and strategic reflections store a searchable summary of what they found. When the
  model wrapped its answer in a markdown ```json fence — which it often does — the summary step failed to
  parse it and stored a truncated raw dump (fence markers included) instead of the assessment and focus,
  degrading later recall. A ```json-tagged fence now parses the same as bare JSON (other fence types
  are left untouched), matching how the rest of the reflection pipeline already reads it.

- **Reflections that omit a confidence score are now recorded honestly instead of masquerading as
  "0.7 confident".** The reflection prompt explicitly forbids defaulting to 0.7, but when a reflection
  came back without a confidence value the system silently filled in 0.7 — indistinguishable from the
  model genuinely reporting it. An absent confidence is now stored as 0.5: deep reflections carry a
  `confidence_defaulted` marker in the cycle's routing record, and light reflections log the sentinel,
  so you can tell reported confidence from a filled-in default.
  The Light reflection prompt also regains its hard output caps and "signals are the only valid
  evidence" verification rule, which were stranded in a prompt file the loader never used.

- **Reactive ego events no longer force the expensive Opus model, critical escalations always think at
  full effort, and a missing ego prompt file fails loudly instead of silently running a placeholder.**
  Reactive events (deadline alerts, breaker trips) used to override every ego onto Opus at high effort
  regardless of your configured model — now each ego handles them on its own base configuration.
  Critical escalations previously ran at *medium* effort (less thinking than a routine tick); they now
  always run at high effort. And if a per-ego identity prompt file is missing, the ego refuses to start
  with a clear error naming the file, instead of quietly substituting a generic placeholder identity
  (the obsolete legacy `EGO_SESSION.md` prompt is removed). The ego prompts themselves also got
  corrections: the user ego no longer lists a health tool it doesn't have, no longer writes the morning
  report (the dedicated morning-report pipeline is the sole source — its daily-briefing cycle now
  focuses on what you need today), and the pending-proposal guidance matches the real threshold.

- **Genesis's COO (self-maintenance ego) no longer burns cognitive cycles reacting to model-provider
  outages it can't fix.** When a provider chain runs out of options (e.g. a temporary DeepSeek outage),
  the "all providers exhausted" alerts no longer wake the ego into a full high-effort reasoning cycle that
  can only conclude "nothing I can do" — these were the large majority of its zero-outcome reactive cycles.
  The outage still reaches the ego through its normal system-health context, so nothing is hidden; it just
  stops paying to react to it. Relatedly, the cross-type procedure-dedup check now skips its judgment call
  outright when that chain is down, instead of firing a doomed request that would raise yet another alert.

- **Genesis's background egos now keep their thinking rhythm across a restart instead of going quiet.**
  The two egos run proactive cycles on an adaptive schedule that stretches out when things are idle. That
  schedule was re-armed from scratch on every restart, so an install that restarts often (deploys, recovery)
  could keep pushing the next cycle further out — in the worst case starving an ego for up to its full
  backed-off interval. Each ego now anchors its first post-restart cycle to when it last actually ran: an
  overdue ego runs shortly after startup, while an up-to-date one simply keeps its cadence.

- **The Internals "composite" self-improvement score is no longer dragged down by draft
  procedures** — Genesis extracts candidate procedures from its own sessions; these start
  unvalidated (near-zero confidence) until they prove useful. The weekly composite score was
  averaging *every* procedure's confidence, so a burst of new drafts made the score crater
  even though nothing had actually regressed. The score now reflects only validated
  procedures. Genesis also caps how many drafts a single session can create, so the
  procedure store stops accumulating dead weight.

- **Genesis stops cluttering its procedure store with general working-style rules.** When it
  learns a "procedure" from a work session, it now tells a reusable *task procedure* (how a
  specific tool or system works) apart from a *behavioral directive* (a general habit like
  "double-check before acting" — which belongs in its standing instructions, not the procedure
  store). Directives are no longer stored, removing the most common source of near-duplicate
  procedures. The check errs toward keeping, so genuine procedures are never dropped.

- **Background research findings reach your knowledge base again — instead of piling up as unreadable
  JSON blobs.** Genesis's idle-time research (brainstorms, gap clustering, code and wing audits) sends its
  findings through an intake step that splits them into individual knowledge entries. That step couldn't
  read the output format models actually produce (code-fenced JSON, and the bare-array shape code audits
  emit), so months of findings were stored as single raw JSON dumps — useless to search and recall. Intake
  now parses these formats, skips empty result envelopes outright, and wing-audit results are split into
  individual findings like the other research types. A new `scripts/cleanup_fenced_knowledge_units.py`
  (dry-run by default) re-parses the previously mangled entries into proper knowledge units and removes
  the junk ones.

- **Re-ingesting a knowledge source with changed content now refreshes it instead of serving the stale
  version.** Previously, once a file or URL was ingested, re-ingesting the same source was skipped on source
  identity alone — so if the underlying content changed, the knowledge base kept serving the old distilled
  version indefinitely. Re-ingestion now compares a content fingerprint and re-distills when the content has
  actually changed (unchanged content is still skipped, and a now-unreachable source falls back to its
  previously cached version).

- **Memory extraction now runs reliably after a restart.** The job that turns recent conversations into
  long-term memories was scheduled on a fixed 2-hour interval measured from server start — and that timer
  reset on every restart, so a box that restarted more often than every two hours could keep deferring
  extraction indefinitely. It now also runs shortly after each start, so extraction can't be starved by
  frequent restarts.

- **Superseded and expired memories no longer resurface in Genesis's automatic recall.** Before every
  prompt, Genesis injects the most relevant memories into its working context. That fast-path recall
  wasn't checking whether a memory had expired or been superseded (replaced by a newer, consolidated
  version) — so an outdated network note, stale career details, an old build-progress snapshot, or a
  duplicate the memory system had already merged away could still surface, even though the main memory
  system filtered all of those out. The fast path now applies the same validity checks across all of
  its sources, matching the main retriever. Memories that are current (no expiry, not superseded) are
  never affected, so nothing live is ever dropped.

- **Deleting a knowledge item from the dashboard now works end to end.** Previously the delete
  button returned a server error, and behind the scenes the item was only half-removed — dropped
  from search but with its stored embedding left behind and its source still marked as already
  ingested, so re-adding that same file or URL was silently skipped and nothing came back. Deletes
  now complete cleanly (search entry and embedding both removed), and once a source's last item is
  deleted, re-ingesting that file or URL works again.

- **Fresh installs and repairs now get scheduled housekeeping running without a manual step.** The
  bootstrap script rendered Genesis's systemd timer units (watchdog health check, daily disk hygiene)
  but never enabled them, so on a new machine — or after a repair re-render — the timers sat installed
  yet dead until something else switched them on. Bootstrap now enables and starts the housekeeping
  timers idempotently, right after the render pass; environments without systemd are unaffected. The
  backup timer is deliberately left for you to enable after configuring backups (passphrase + verify
  run), so it is not auto-started here.

- **Completed background-task history no longer grows without bound.** Genesis's idle-time "surplus"
  task queue kept every finished task row forever — only never-started tasks were ever cleaned up — so
  the table crept upward over months of background work. Finished tasks (completed, failed, or
  cancelled) are now aged out after 30 days, while any task still referenced by an open follow-up is
  kept until that follow-up resolves.

- **The weekly self-assessment and quality-calibration jobs now recover on their own instead of
  going dark for weeks.** Previously each ran only once a week, so if that one run failed — for
  example when the shared Claude Code subscription was capped and returned empty output — the next
  attempt wasn't until the following week, and a multi-day outage could leave them stale for 2–3
  weeks. They now run daily but still complete at most once per week (an idempotency check skips the
  rest of the week once one run succeeds), so a failed day is simply retried the next day until it
  succeeds. Side effect: the successful run now normally lands early in the week rather than on Sunday.

- **Campaign results no longer sit uncaptured until the next scheduled tick.** Previously a
  campaign that ran every couple of days would finish its background session but not record
  the outcome (or cost, or notify you) until the *following* tick — so a finished run could
  stay invisible for days, and its spend went uncounted. A new reaper now captures finished
  sessions within minutes and cleans up runs orphaned by past crashes, so campaign status and
  cost stay accurate in near-real-time.

- **Uploading a large or malformed PDF to the Knowledge tab no longer freezes — or crashes — Genesis.**
  PDF text extraction used to run directly on the main event loop, so a big document could stall the whole
  server for seconds (health checks, background thinking, other requests all waited), and a corrupt or
  hostile PDF could take the process down entirely. Extraction now runs in an isolated worker process with a
  time limit: a large PDF no longer blocks anything else, and a PDF that crashes or hangs the parser fails
  just that one ingest — the rest of Genesis keeps running. Uploads that hit a transient database hiccup are
  now marked "failed" (and can be retried) instead of getting stuck showing "processing" forever.

- **A casual message can no longer be mistaken for a permanent "hard rule" — and your
  steering-rules file keeps its structure.** Genesis auto-adds a steering rule only when you
  actually give it a terse directive ("stop doing X", "never do Y"); an ordinary status update
  or chatty reply is no longer captured verbatim as a hard constraint, even if Genesis misread
  the moment. And when a rule is added, the section headings and layout of your `STEERING.md`
  are preserved instead of being flattened into one run-on list.

- **Conversations can take as long as the work genuinely needs, and no longer time out twice in
  a row.** The time budget for a Claude Code turn was a too-short 10 minutes, so substantial work
  started in chat could be cut off mid-task; it is now 2 hours, and a turn that does hit the limit
  no longer silently retries from scratch (which previously doubled the wait before giving up).
  Genesis is also guided to break large jobs into steps and hand genuinely long work to a
  background session it reports back on, rather than leaving you waiting in silence.

- **Genesis no longer mistakes your status updates for its own failures.** When you tell Genesis
  how your own projects, plans, or deadlines are going ("the offer fell through", "I didn't attend
  the conference", "let's keep going on the paper — it's never too late"), it sometimes scored the
  whole interaction as its own "approach failure" — which could trigger a spurious learned rule in
  STEERING.md and dock the autonomy it had earned. Genesis now judges an interaction only by the
  concrete tasks it actually attempted that turn, so sharing context, expressing a future intent, or
  getting a clarifying question back before it acts is correctly treated as success. Genuine
  shortfalls on tasks it did attempt — including when they're mixed into the same message as a status
  update — are still caught.

- **Inbox notes that change without adding anything new no longer get re-scanned over and over.**
  Editing an inbox note in a way that changes its bytes but not its actual content — re-pasting a
  link with different tracking/share parameters, reordering lines, tweaking whitespace — used to
  leave the note looking "modified" on every scan, which (while a link approval was pending) could
  repeatedly cancel and recreate that approval. Genesis now recognizes there's no new content and
  marks the note current in a single scan, so it settles instead of churning.

- **Two pending inbox approvals could cancel each other forever, re-pinging you every 30 minutes for
  nothing.** When new content arrived while one link approval was still pending, the refresh step
  invalidated every row parked on it — including an unrelated file's — but only re-queued the
  newly-detected file. That other file's rows reappeared as "new" on the very next scan, which
  cancelled the fresh approval in turn: two files could leapfrog cancel-and-recreate every
  30-minute scan with zero actual change on disk. Invalidated files are now folded into the same
  refresh batch, so one merged approval covers everything in a single cycle instead of chasing itself.

- **Links that fail partway through an evaluation now retry themselves.** When only some of the
  links in a note evaluate successfully and the rest fail (for example, a few get rate-limited),
  the failed links used to sit untouched until you edited the note again. Genesis now
  automatically re-attempts the stranded links on a later scan on its own — bounded so a link that
  keeps failing eventually stops retrying rather than looping.

- **Inbox evaluations no longer cram a whole batch of links into one giant pass — and stop
  re-evaluating links they've already covered.** When you drop many URLs into an inbox note,
  Genesis now evaluates them in small groups (≈5 at a time, configurable via
  `items_per_eval`), each producing its own `…-N.genesis.md` response file, instead of one
  sprawling evaluation of everything at once. Crucially, once a link has been evaluated it is
  not re-evaluated when you add new links to the same note — only the genuinely new links are
  processed (previously an approved evaluation could re-chew the entire file). When the CLI
  approval gate is on, you approve a drop once and all its groups run under that single
  approval. Duplicate follow-up items from the same recommendation are now also prevented.

- **An approved inbox evaluation that gets interrupted mid-run can no longer be evaluated
  twice.** If the server restarted (or crashed) in the narrow window right after you approved a
  link evaluation but before it finished, the next scan could re-run the same evaluation and
  write a duplicate `…-N.genesis.md` file. Genesis now claims each evaluation the moment it
  starts, so an interrupted one is recovered and retried rather than run a second time.

- **Genesis no longer floods its own approvals with follow-up emails addressed to itself.**
  A follow-up drafted in a background session could lose its thread (and therefore its
  recipient) on the way to the outreach queue, then fall back to Genesis's own email address.
  The capability gate correctly held each one for approval, but because the queue kept
  retrying, a new held "email to myself" piled up every few minutes. Genesis now keeps the
  thread recipient with the queued message, never sends an email to its own address, and
  treats a held or undeliverable message as resolved instead of retrying it forever. A
  message that can never be delivered is now dropped after a day rather than looping.

### Security

- **The contribution sanitizer now blocks Tailscale addresses before they can reach the public
  repo.** When you prepare a community contribution, the pre-push privacy scan now catches Tailscale
  CGNAT and Tailscale IPv6 addresses, and flags the full private RFC1918 subnet range (not just two
  hard-coded addresses) — closing a gap where these install-specific addresses could otherwise slip
  into a public PR. The commit-message guard gained the same IPv6 coverage.

- **The HTTP client Genesis uses for outbound requests is upgraded to clear 11 security advisories.**
  `aiohttp` — the library behind health checks, provider pings, and market/price-data fetches — now
  requires 3.14.1 or newer, which fixes 11 published CVEs (including a cookie-leak-on-redirect issue
  and several denial-of-service vectors). Genesis uses it only as a client for outbound calls, so
  real-world exposure was limited, but the newer version removes the advisories outright.

- **The autonomy gate now honors each action category's context ceiling before auto-dispatching a
  background action.** When deciding whether a background action may run, the gate compared the
  required level against the raw *earned* level — so a category that had earned a high level could
  clear a bar it shouldn't in a more restricted context, most notably letting a financial action pass
  its level check. It now uses the ceiling-clamped effective level, so background auto-dispatch of
  higher-risk categories (e.g. financial) is refused regardless of earned level. Your explicit
  approval was, and still is, required for these actions — this closes a defense-in-depth gap behind
  that approval.

- **The Genesis→host control SSH key is now bound to the container's source address and denied an
  interactive terminal.** The key that lets the container drive recovery on the host is installed with
  a `from=` source-IP restriction and `no-pty`, so a copied key can't be used from another machine on
  your LAN and can't request a shell. Re-running the Guardian installer upgrades an existing key in
  place; if the source address can't be confirmed it keeps the terminal restriction and safely skips
  the address lock (verified by the installer's own connectivity test) rather than risk locking
  Guardian out.

## [v3.0b16] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **Genesis earns email autonomy you can revoke in one click** (#734, #737, #738) — once Genesis has sent a kind
  of email with your approval enough times, it proposes a promotion: it asks "may I send these
  on my own from now on?" — and only you can say yes. If a promoted send ever goes wrong, that
  autonomy is revoked immediately and the next send holds for your approval again, whether the
  system catches it (a send to the wrong person, or a sudden burst of sends) or you flag it
  yourself. A new dashboard **Autonomy** tab shows what Genesis is allowed to do on its own and
  a log of what it has done, with a "Flag as bad" button on every autonomous send. A per-send
  Telegram notice is available but off by default (the tab is where to look) — turn it on with
  `email_send_notify` in the autonomy config.

- **See what Genesis did as a timeline** (#718, #726) — the dashboard has a new **Traces** tab that
  renders each recorded operation (a reflection, an ego cycle, a dispatched session) as a
  nested waterfall: pick a recent trace and its LLM calls, sub-sessions, and tools lay out as
  bars on a shared timeline, with click-through detail for any span (provider, model, tokens,
  cost, attributes). It reads the traces Genesis already captures, so you can inspect an
  operation end to end instead of piecing it together from logs.

- **Genesis can A/B-test its own thinking before changing it** (#729) — a new experimentation
  harness runs two versions of a cognitive config (for example a reflection prompt, or an
  awareness signal weight) against a graded golden set, measures which does better with a
  real significance test, and surfaces a recommendation you act on — it never promotes a
  change on its own. It guards against gaming its own grader (the rubric must be calibrated,
  and a "win" has to survive a second, independent judge). Results show up in the new
  `experiment_status` health tool, and a weekly "cognitive drift" snapshot now tracks whether
  Genesis is still challenging itself (dissent rate, proposal diversity).

- **Genesis spots goals it's stuck on and asks before easing off them** (#720) — when a goal you
  set has been worked on (several dispatched sessions) but still isn't moving, Genesis now
  recognizes it as *stuck* rather than merely idle, bumps it up for review, and digs into
  *why* it stalled instead of nudging it again. If it concludes the goal should be paused or
  deprioritized, that becomes a proposal you approve or reject — nothing about your goals
  changes without your say-so.

- **Genesis records traces of what it does** (#718, #722) — reflections, ego cycles, every LLM
  call, and the tools its dispatched Claude Code sessions run are now captured as
  nested trace spans (one trace per operation), so its activity can be inspected
  end to end instead of pieced together from logs. Capture is on by default and can
  be turned off via the new `observability` settings domain (or
  `GENESIS_SPANS_DISABLED=1`); spans are kept for a configurable window (default 14
  days) and pruned automatically.

- **You can undo a change Genesis made to its own skills or calibration** (#717) — when Genesis
  autonomously refines a skill, retunes its triage calibration, or re-synthesizes its user
  knowledge, it now keeps a recoverable snapshot of the previous version. If one of those
  self-edits turns out worse, you can list the recent self-modifications and roll any of them
  back to its prior contents — with a safety check that refuses to overwrite a file that has
  changed since (unless you force it).

- **Earned autonomy can be restored after a regression** (#715) — when Genesis loses a level of
  autonomy in a category (e.g. after a correction), that demotion is no longer a dead end. Once
  the category's track record recovers enough that the evidence again supports the earned level,
  Genesis proposes restoring it and asks you to approve — it never silently re-grants authority,
  and it won't nag while the lower level is genuinely warranted. Previously a demoted category
  had no path back up.
- **Genesis tells its own memories apart from what it read on the world** (#716) — every recalled
  knowledge-base item (ingested docs, and the new corrective web results) is now labeled
  "external-world knowledge (source: …)" wherever it reaches Genesis's context: explicit
  recall, the proactive memory hook, voice, and the dashboard memory search. First-party
  memories (Genesis's own observations and your conversations) stay labeled as such, so the
  model never mistakes an ingested document — or a web snippet — for its own ground truth.
  The knowledge-base relevance floor that keeps low-quality bulk content out of answers now
  applies reliably (it previously slipped past keyword-only matches).

- **Genesis self-corrects a bad memory recall instead of running with it** (#711) — on high-stakes
  lookups (the explicit memory and knowledge recall tools), Genesis now grades whether the
  recalled results are actually on-topic, and when a recall comes back clearly irrelevant it
  automatically tries again — broadening the search, drawing on the knowledge base, and (for
  knowledge queries only) the web — rather than feeding itself off-topic context. Conservative
  by design: confident recalls are left untouched, grading is skipped when results are already
  strong, and it fails fast so it never slows a recall if the grader is unavailable. Latency-
  sensitive paths (the proactive hook, voice, in-session context injection) are unaffected.

- **The dashboard's Observations panel shows where each item stands** (#697) — every observation
  now carries a colour-coded stage badge: **new** (unread, still needs attention), **read**
  (Genesis has seen it), **acted** (it drove a proposal or follow-up), or **resolved**.
  Already-seen items stop blaring, so the panel — and Genesis's own thinking — surface what's
  genuinely new instead of a wall of stale alerts.

- **Browse and manage your reference store from the dashboard** (#674, #676) — a new **References** tab
  lists every credential, URL, IP, and account handle Genesis has stored, grouped by kind, with
  search and a per-entry badge showing whether you saved it (verified) or Genesis auto-captured
  it. Secret values stay hidden until you click reveal, then you can copy or delete any entry.
  This replaces the old `~/.genesis/known-to-genesis.md` text file (now retired) with a single,
  always-current, access-controlled view — no more stale or secret-leaking flat file.

- **Genesis now detects and auto-heals a stalled Guardian updater** (#669, #670) — it watches whether the
  Guardian's *deployed* updater script on the host matches the code it has actually pulled. If
  the updater silently froze (the failure that left it ~2 months stale), Genesis notices within
  a few checks, automatically redeploys the current updater once, and re-verifies — escalating
  to you only if the self-heal doesn't resolve it. Closes the blind spot where the host kept
  pulling new code while its updater quietly stopped refreshing.

- **A new "deliverable-builder" skill produces send-ready work, not raw markdown** (#657) — when you
  ask Genesis to build a job take-home, client report, one-pager, or deck, it runs a gated
  pipeline: it frames the deliverable with you (audience, format, what leads), drafts and
  structures it to lead with the strongest point, writes it in your voice, strips AI tells,
  renders it to the right file format (PDF or DOCX, never a raw `.md`), and a fresh-context
  reviewer checks the finished artifact against the original requirements before it reaches you.
  The session won't quietly end with an unverified deliverable.

- **Background tasks can now produce those deliverables on their own** (#668) — when a `/task` you
  submit will produce a send-ready artifact (report, deck, take-home, one-pager), the intake now
  captures how it should look and read (format, visual style, whether it must pass as fully
  human-written, audience), and the autonomous executor runs the deliverable-builder pipeline as
  the final step — handing you the finished, verified file instead of a raw dump. Rendered
  documents now default to a clean modern font (so they read like a real document, not a LaTeX
  paper); set the visual style to `formal` or `academic` to change it.

- **Content Genesis sends to other people is auto-cleaned before it goes out** (#654) —
  email, Discord, and the article/post drafts you review now pass through a
  deterministic check that fixes the most common AI giveaway (a spaced em dash,
  `like — this`) and scans for accidentally-included secrets (API keys,
  credentials) before the message leaves Genesis. Messages to *you* (Telegram,
  voice) are left exactly as written.

- **Genesis now watches its own database journal size** (#647, #687) — if SQLite's
  write-ahead log grows abnormally large (the sign of a stuck database reader
  holding the file open), Genesis raises a high/critical alert on Telegram and in
  the morning report, instead of letting it balloon silently for days.

- **The dashboard shows your database journal (WAL) size at a glance** (#687) — the
  Infrastructure health panel now displays the SQLite WAL size next to the
  database probe, colored green / amber / red, so you can spot DB-lock pressure
  building before it ever trips an alert.

### Changed

- **Your morning report now tells you what to do, not just what happened** (#733) — it
  ends with a **Next Steps & Blockers** section that names the few highest-leverage
  actions for the day and what's blocking progress (a stalled follow-up, a pending
  approval, an issue gating one of your goals), drawn only from items already in
  the report. This replaces the vaguer "follow-up suggestions" guidance, so the
  briefing highlights what matters and the action it implies instead of just
  aggregating status.

- **Interactive Claude Code consoles can run friction-free again, when you want
  them to** — the SSH/tmux dev-console slot and the dashboard web terminal still
  default to `--permission-mode auto` (auto-approves common operations, but still
  prompts you on deny/ask rules), but you can now opt a session back into
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` by setting `GENESIS_CC_PERMISSION_MODE=bypass`.
  For the SSH slot, put that line in `~/.genesis/cc-slot.env` (SSH sessions don't
  read your shell profile); for the dashboard terminal, set it in the dashboard's
  environment. Headless autonomous sessions are unaffected.

- **`update.sh` now keeps Claude Code in sync on your host VM too** — if you run
  Genesis with a Guardian on a separate host VM, updates previously only touched
  the container's Claude Code, letting the host drift behind. `update.sh` now
  checks the host's version against a single pin (`scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`)
  and updates the host to match when it has drifted, so container and host never
  fall out of step. It's skipped when already in sync and never fails your update
  if the host is unreachable.
- **Voice: you now choose exactly which alerts are spoken aloud** (#618) — the
  Voice PE only speaks alerts on an allowlist you control (`voice.alert_ids`
  in `outreach.yaml`) instead of chiming for every blocker, alert, and
  approval. The default set covers what's worth interrupting you for: disk
  and memory emergencies, memory-system failures (embeddings, vector
  search), a stalled awareness loop, Sentinel decisions that need your
  approval, and blocked autonomous tasks. CLI approval prompts and generic
  provider credit-exhaustion no longer chime by default. Everything still
  arrives on Telegram regardless — this only controls what's spoken out loud.
- **Earlier memory and memory-search alerts** (#618) — the container-memory alert
  now fires at 85% (was 90%) and the vector-search-failure alert at 50%
  failure (was 100% only), so you hear about pressure and degradation
  sooner, on both Telegram and voice.
- **Voice runs from its own repo now** — the Voice PE device firmware and the
  voice bridges (the conversational OpenAI Realtime bridge, plus a new
  ambient-listening capture service) have moved to the separate
  [GENesis-Voice](https://github.com/WingedGuardian/GENesis-Voice) repo, which
  documents the full setup. Genesis keeps its internal voice integration; if you
  flash the device or run a voice bridge, get them from GENesis-Voice.

### Fixed

- **Inbox items added soon after an evaluation are no longer silently skipped** (#736) — if you added a
  link or note to an inbox file within the cool-down window just after Genesis had evaluated that
  file, the new item could be marked as seen without ever being evaluated, and it stayed stranded
  until you edited the file again. Genesis now defers those additions and picks them up on the
  next pass once the cool-down clears, so nothing you add gets lost.

- **Re-sharing an article you already added no longer creates a duplicate evaluation** (#736) — links
  often carry per-share tracking parameters (for example, the same LinkedIn post shared from your
  phone vs. your desktop produces different URLs), which used to make a re-paste look brand new.
  Genesis now ignores those tracking parameters when deciding what's new, so the same article
  isn't evaluated twice or spawn a duplicate follow-up.

- **Voice approvals now resolve the action you actually mean** (#731) — when you say "approve" or
  "reject" over voice, Genesis tells you which action it acted on, and if more than one action is
  awaiting your decision it reads the options back and asks which one — instead of silently
  resolving whichever was most recent (which could be the wrong one).

- **Fewer false health alarms about Genesis's own subsystems** (#723, #725, #728, #732) — several background loops report
  health through a periodic heartbeat, and a couple could trip "overdue" or "dark" alarms while
  perfectly healthy. The ego's check-in rode its proactive-thinking timer, which slows during quiet
  periods and gets pushed back by other work, so it could go hours between ticks and trip the 4-hour
  alarm; and the reflection loop only emitted a heartbeat when it actually ran one, so calm overnight
  stretches read as silent. Both now send a steady lightweight "alive" heartbeat independent of their
  work pace. Separately, weekly "quality drift" and "learning regression" warnings no longer linger:
  each weekly check supersedes and clears the previous flag once the metric recovers, the regression
  alarm only fires on a sustained drop rather than a noisy wobble, and anything older than three days
  is demoted and tagged historical instead of repeated as a fresh alarm.

- **Genesis's self-quality metrics are now accurate** (#708, #724) — several bugs were skewing the numbers Genesis
  uses to grade its own competence (the J9 readiness grades, the morning-report quality figures, and
  the gate that decides which self-improvements ship). Memory retrieval quality (MRR) was computed
  against database arrival order instead of the actual retrieval rank; each memory search logged its
  internal "recall" event twice, inflating the counts; reflection quality was scored as a running
  total over the newest reflections, so it drifted downward purely because new reflections hadn't been
  referenced yet (a "quality crater" that was a measurement artifact); and a malformed LLM-judge
  verdict was silently recorded as a confident "0 / fail" instead of an error. All now reflect
  reality — reflection quality is measured over a fair, fixed age window and reports "insufficient
  data" when there aren't enough mature reflections, and the readiness grades and ship-gate are
  trustworthy. Genesis also now tracks whether its ranking merely favors the memories it retrieves
  most often, so entrenchment can be watched over time.

- **Knowledge-base searches stopped silently returning nothing** (#721) — the relevance floor that
  trims low-quality knowledge results was a fixed absolute cutoff that, on the score scale recall
  actually produces, sat above the entire range — so searching the knowledge base (or a broad
  memory search across everything) could return *zero* knowledge results even when directly
  relevant ingested documents existed. The floor is now relative to the best-matching result, so
  the strongest knowledge hit always survives and a proportional tail of weaker matches is kept,
  regardless of the underlying score scale.

- **Memory search got more precise on multi-word queries** (#721) — query expansion (which broadens a
  search with related terms) could pull in documents that matched only a broad category tag —
  the structural labels like class/wing/life-domain that Genesis attaches to *every* memory — so
  an off-topic document could outrank genuinely relevant ones. Those ever-present structural tags
  are now excluded from expansion, and for multi-word queries the related terms only *boost*
  documents that already match part of your query rather than surfacing on their own.

- **Genesis no longer loses contradicting or superseding links between memories** (#719) — its memory
  graph could only hold one relationship between any two memories, so recording a second kind
  (for example marking a pair as "contradicts" when they were already linked as "supports", or
  "succeeded_by" when one memory replaces another) was silently dropped. Different relationship
  types between the same two memories are now all kept, so Genesis reasons over a fuller, more
  honest picture of how its memories relate.

- **Procedure learning survives a two-provider outage** (#710) — the routine that captures reusable
  procedures from Genesis's own struggles ran on only two free model providers; when both were
  down at once it exhausted its chain and silently stopped learning. A third independent free
  fallback now keeps it working through overlapping provider outages.

- **Star-count updates no longer crowd high-priority alerts** (#714) — GitHub star-count reconnaissance
  pings inherited their watched project's priority (e.g. "high" for the main repo), so vanity
  "+N stars" deltas competed with genuinely important findings in the morning report and alert
  lane. They're now recorded at low priority — still tracked for trend deltas, just no longer
  treated as urgent.

- **Genesis's at-a-glance state views stopped showing internal noise** (#712) — three cleanups to the
  dashboard and to Genesis's own always-on context: empty sessions (ended before any messages were
  exchanged) no longer appear as ghost "0 msgs" rows in the recent-sessions list; the "Active Work"
  summary no longer ingests raw harness notifications (task-completion blobs, system reminders,
  slash-command metadata) as if they were your prompts; and the memory "Wings" breakdown shows only
  real, controlled-vocabulary domains instead of malformed or one-off tags. What you — and Genesis —
  see reflects genuine activity, not plumbing.

- **A campaign that crashes mid-tick no longer fails silently** (#706) — when a scheduled campaign
  tick raises an error, Genesis now records it in job-health tracking, so the failure surfaces
  in the dashboard and to the ego instead of vanishing into the server log. Campaign
  reliability problems become visible instead of going unnoticed.

- **Surplus brainstorm messages read like prose, not raw JSON** (#707) — Genesis's background
  brainstorm ideas posted to the Telegram "Surplus" topic now render as clean bulleted text
  (idea, detail, and why it matters) instead of the raw ```json``` code block the model
  produces. Plain-text and non-JSON messages are unaffected.
- **The neural monitor labels every cognitive call site correctly.** (#702) Eight call sites
  that previously showed blank (the eval judge, voice conversation, session observer,
  task pre-mortem, intelligence intake, both resume-review passes, and the executor's
  failure-exit gate) now display their purpose, category, and cost. Sites that actually
  run on the Claude Code subscription (the ego cycle and the deep/strategic/weekly/quality
  reflections) now read "CC background" with their CC model shown in the chain, instead of
  being mislabeled as a paid API cost.

- **Updates now reliably load the new code** (#700) — an update could finish "successfully"
  while the running Genesis process kept executing the *old* code: when the updater
  stopped the server, systemd's auto-restart could bring it back on the pre-update
  code before the new code was even pulled, and the updater's final restart was a
  no-op on the already-running process. The database migrated but the live process
  didn't, leaving new code on disk and old code in memory. The updater now forces a
  true restart at the end and makes sure the server stays down during the upgrade, so
  an update always activates the version it just installed.
- **Spend on GLM, MiniMax and other aggregator models is now reported accurately** (#701) — these
  providers' usage was silently recorded as $0 because their model names aren't in the cost
  library Genesis relies on, hiding real spend in cost reports. Genesis now falls back to each
  model's configured price when the library can't price it, so spend reflects what you're
  actually using. (Visibility only — it never throttles or blocks calls.)

- **Queued retries survive a routing-config change** (#701) — every time the provider routing config
  was reloaded (e.g. toggling a provider in the dashboard), Genesis was expiring *all* of the
  queued "retry the whole chain" requests before its scheduled retry job could replay them.
  Those items now persist across a config reload and get retried as intended.
- **A rate-limited or over-budget request no longer knocks a working provider offline** (#703) —
  when a provider replied "too many requests" (429) or rejected a single request as too large
  or against policy (400/422), Genesis treated it like an outage: it retried the doomed request
  several times and tripped that provider's circuit breaker, taking it out of rotation for
  everything else for up to 30 minutes. Now those responses fail straight over to the next
  provider without retrying or benching the one that's actually healthy — so you get faster
  failover and far fewer false "provider down" blips.
- **Idle fallback providers heal on their own instead of staying stuck** (#705) — a provider that
  recovered from an outage but then received little or no traffic could sit in a half-recovered
  "on probation" state indefinitely, because only a real successful request could fully clear it.
  Genesis's free health probes now confirm such a provider is reachable and restore it to normal
  rotation (and clear its lingering "failing" alert), so rarely-used backups don't get permanently
  benched.

- **A single request can't hang for minutes across retries and failover** (#705) — each routing profile
  now has an aggregate time budget, so the worst case where one request's retries multiply across
  the whole provider chain into a multi-minute stall is bounded. It only caps the retry/failover
  multiplier on one request (checked between attempts, never mid-call) — background thinking that
  legitimately takes a while is unaffected.

- **Recovered providers stop alarming once they come back** (#698) — when a model provider's
  circuit breaker reopens after an outage, Genesis now clears that provider's "failing"
  alert instead of leaving it lingering for days until it expired. Per-session conversation
  telemetry no longer floods the Observations panel either, so the panel reflects current
  state rather than a backlog of stale entries.

- **Cost reporting now shows your real spend, not a phantom figure** (#694) — the health
  tool that Genesis's reflections consult was reporting a *notional* "if Claude Code
  were billed by the API" number (hundreds of dollars a month) as if it were actual
  cost, with no budget context. That phantom figure drove false "cost is accelerating"
  alerts in reflections and the morning report. Genesis now reports true spend from
  recorded cost events against your configured budget. The morning report shows a
  single grounded line — month-to-date spend versus your cap — with no projections or
  spike alarms, and reflections no longer analyze cost at all.

- **No more false "CRITICAL / degraded" alarm when a paid provider runs out of
  credits** — health now judges degradation by whether your *essential* work is
  covered, not by how many paid providers are down. If OpenRouter (or any paid
  provider) goes down but your free providers still cover the essentials,
  Genesis stays NORMAL instead of flashing a system-wide CRITICAL. The alarm
  now fires only when an essential capability genuinely has no working provider.

- **Clearer API-key colors on the dashboard** (#698) — the API Keys panel now shows
  🟡 yellow for a key that's missing/unconfigured, 🔴 red for a key that's set
  but not working (circuit breaker open, including out-of-credits), and 🟢 green
  for working. A paid provider that's down now shows up red on the API-keys card
  (e.g. "openrouter — out of credits") without raising a system-wide alarm.
- **Approving a light reflection's Claude Code fallback now actually runs it** (#693) —
  when all of light reflection's free model providers were down at once, Genesis
  would ask you to approve a Claude Code fallback, but approving it did nothing:
  the reflection was never resumed (only deep and strategic reflections were).
  Light reflections are now resumed on approval like the others, and a deferred
  reflection is logged instead of silently dropped.

- **Genesis can now detect replies to the emails it sends** (#689) — outbound email
  was going out without a real Message-ID header, so mail clients couldn't thread
  it and Genesis couldn't match incoming replies back to the original message.
  Outbound mail now carries a proper Message-ID, so replies are recognized and
  routed to the right conversation.

- **Background work deferred during an outage is no longer silently dropped** (#689) —
  when the system was degraded, the recovery pass marked queued reflection and
  outreach work "done" without ever running it, and a stuck outreach item could
  block reflection retries entirely. Deferred work is now kept until it actually
  runs, reflections are no longer blocked behind it, and recovery holds off
  re-trying until the system is genuinely stable.

- **The skill auto-tuner can no longer truncate a large skill** (#687) — Genesis's
  weekly skill-refinement pass reviewed long skill files from a clipped
  3,000-character view and could auto-apply a much shorter rewrite, silently
  dropping most of the content. It now reviews the full skill, and any
  auto-applied edit that would shrink a skill below half its size is held for
  review instead of overwriting the file.

- **The dashboard's degraded-mode banner no longer overflows** (#687) — a long
  "providers down" summary now wraps instead of spilling past the edge on
  narrow windows.

- **Telegram approval buttons work again** (#686) — tapping the inline **Approve** / **Approve all**
  buttons (and any inline-keyboard button) had silently stopped doing anything for several days.
  Telegram was dropping every button press before Genesis received it, because the Guardian's
  recovery-approval check had narrowed the bot's update filter to text messages only. Genesis now
  always requests Telegram's default update set (which includes button presses) — and the Guardian
  check no longer narrows it — so button presses are delivered and resolve immediately again.

- **Off-site backups can now actually be restored** (#673) — the large data (the
  database, vector memory, and transcripts) is stored only on your off-site
  (NAS) target, but the restore tool had no way to fetch it — so a from-scratch
  recovery silently couldn't bring back your database or memory. Restore now
  pulls the latest off-site snapshot before restoring, and backups are written
  as dated point-in-time snapshots (so you can recover a *specific* run, not just
  the last one) with transcripts included off-site too.

- **A backup that can't reach off-site storage no longer fails silently** (#672) — if
  you've configured an off-site (NAS) backup target and a run captures your data
  locally but can't replicate it off-site, Genesis now sends a distinct alert
  ("off-site replication failed — local backup OK") and records `offsite_confirmed`
  in the backup status. The backup still counts as successful (your local copy is
  intact); only the off-site replica is flagged as missing. Local-only setups (no
  off-site target) are unaffected.

- **Restoring a backup is now safe against corruption** (#671) — `restore.sh` now stops
  the running Genesis server before swapping the SQLite database (so a live
  connection can't corrupt the restore), clears stale write-ahead-log sidecars
  that would otherwise replay onto and corrupt the restored DB, and runs an
  integrity check on the result — warning loudly if it's not sound. It
  deliberately leaves the server stopped afterward so you can verify the restore
  before bringing Genesis back up.

- **The host Guardian's self-update no longer throws away your local config on a
  conflict** — when it pulls new code and a local setting (e.g. the container IP)
  clashes with an upstream change to the same lines, the update used to silently
  discard those local changes. It now preserves them in a recoverable git stash
  (and tells you they're recoverable) instead of dropping them. The update also
  reports its result reliably, so a successful update that pulled changes is no
  longer misread as a failure.

- **Guardian host updates no longer silently stall** (#670) — on hosts where the
  Guardian's `CLAUDE.md` had been pinned with git's skip-worktree flag, the
  Guardian's self-update (`git pull`) would abort the moment that file changed
  upstream, quietly leaving the host Guardian stuck on old code. The update now
  clears the flag first, so existing installs self-heal and stay current.

- **Guardian host self-updates are now reliable on hosts with passwordless sudo** (#669)
  — an unguarded step while refreshing kernel tuning could make the Guardian's
  self-update abort partway, so it reported a failure (and could leave its own
  updater script frozen on old code) even though the code pull had already
  succeeded. Kernel tuning is now strictly best-effort and can't derail the
  update; the update reliably refreshes the updater first and records what it
  deployed; and there's a new one-step recovery path to refresh a stalled updater.

- **Telegram `/stop` now stops your session, not a background task** (#656) — when a
  background task (reflection, inbox, an ego session, etc.) was running at the
  same time as your chat, `/stop` could interrupt the wrong one. Each session's
  Claude Code subprocess is now tracked separately, so `/stop` always targets
  the generation in your conversation.

- **The Guardian alerts once when Genesis goes down — and once when it's back** (#655) —
  previously, if Genesis went down and its diagnosis couldn't reach Claude Code,
  the host Guardian re-ran a full investigation and re-sent a critical Telegram
  alert every 30 seconds until recovery — an alert storm. It now sends a single
  "down" alert per outage (no repeats, however long it lasts), and when Genesis
  comes back on its own it sends a single "restored" notification — which it
  never did before.

- **"database is locked" errors under load are largely gone** (#634, #647) — several independent paths could pin
  the database or fail on a transient lock. A cancelled read could leave a stale lock while the
  write-ahead log ballooned (it reached ~2 GB); a long-lived MCP connection left read transactions
  open after read-only calls, pinning the WAL and making `memory_store` / `reference_store` fail until
  a restart; and several standalone connections (the ego tools, web-agent cost tracking, the
  contribution gate, and two hooks) opened with no wait-for-lock timeout, so brief contention failed
  immediately. Reads are now cancellation-safe with a size-bounded journal, MCP calls release their
  snapshot at each boundary and are serialized, and the standalone connections share one WAL-aware
  helper with a bounded wait — so writes ride out transient contention and the WAL stays bounded.

- **Claude Code hooks work from a git worktree again** — the hook launcher
  located the Python venv via a `git worktree list | head` pipeline that, with
  many worktrees, died on SIGPIPE under `set -o pipefail` and **silently
  disabled every hook** (session activity capture, file/edit audit logging) when
  you ran Claude Code from a worktree. It now resolves the main repo with
  `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` (no pipe), so hooks fire reliably everywhere.
- **Outreach emails actually send now** (#637) — email (and Discord/voice) outreach was
  being misaddressed to the Telegram forum chat for any category that routes to
  the supergroup, so every such send failed and silently piled up as retries.
  Forum/topic routing is now correctly Telegram-only; other channels deliver to
  their own recipient.
- **A slow or failed email can no longer stall Genesis** (#637) — SMTP sending now runs
  off the event loop, so a hung or rejected send no longer freezes heartbeats,
  health checks, or the awareness loop.
- **Provider hangs no longer stall reflections and the dream cycle** (#627) — when a
  model provider hangs (accepts the connection but never responds), Genesis
  now fails over to the next provider within its timeout instead of blocking
  for minutes. Reflections and the nightly dream cycle stop piling up
  dead-lettered work during provider outages, and adversarial review and
  reflections keep running when free-tier providers are down (extra free
  fallbacks added, plus a paid last-resort for the dream-cycle challenge).
- **The weekly memory consolidation (dream cycle) no longer melts down during a
  provider outage.** Previously, if its LLM providers were unavailable, the run
  attempted every cluster anyway — burning hours and flooding the retry queue
  while merging almost nothing. It now aborts early once the providers are
  clearly saturated and defers the rest to the next run, and no longer
  dead-letters its own consolidation attempts.
- **Job health no longer shows a permanent failure after a job recovers.** (#624)
  A scheduled job that failed once kept that failure timestamp in the health
  view forever, even after it started succeeding again; recovery now clears
  the stale failure and error so job health reflects reality.
- **Circuit-breaker trips now survive a restart.** (#626) A provider that tripped
  open was silently coming back available on every restart (a saved-state
  casing mismatch), so a failing provider got retried immediately instead of
  serving out its backoff. Breaker state is now also written atomically, and
  MCP helper processes no longer overwrite the shared state file.
- **The error log no longer silently under-counts during incident storms.** (#631)
  When the event-persistence queue filled up, events were dropped without a
  trace — so the dashboard and health views under-reported errors exactly when
  things were worst. Dropped events are now counted and made visible (an
  "event queue overflow" warning in the same error views, plus a live counter
  on the health snapshot), the buffer is 10× larger (500 → 5000) to absorb
  bursts, and a single un-serializable event can no longer drop a whole batch.
- **Dashboard settings changes now actually take effect.** (#632) Overrides you saved
  from the dashboard (or the settings tool) are written to `~/.genesis/config/`,
  but several subsystems (inbox, surplus, resilience, voice/TTS, perception
  confidence, and more) still read their `.local.yaml` overlay from the repo's
  `config/` dir — so your changes were silently ignored, even after a restart.
  Loaders now read the user-config overlay first (falling back to the repo path
  for older installs), and the settings tool reports the correct saved path.

### Security

- **Hardened remote Claude Code dispatch against shell injection.** (#625) The SSH
  module adapter now shell-quotes the model, effort, and path values it sends
  to a remote host, so a crafted value can no longer run arbitrary commands
  there. Normal dispatch is unchanged.
- **Documented the dashboard's network-exposure model.** (#646) `SECURITY.md` now
  spells out that the dashboard binds all interfaces for proxy/overlay reach
  and that its `/api`, `/v1`, web terminal, and noVNC console are
  unauthenticated administrative access — so operators know to keep those ports
  on a private overlay (e.g., Tailscale) or behind a reverse proxy and never
  expose them publicly.
- **Interactive Claude Code consoles no longer skip all permission checks.** (#630, #646)
  The dashboard web terminal and the SSH dev-console slot now launch Claude
  Code in auto-permission mode instead of `--dangerously-skip-permissions`:
  common operations still run without prompting, but risky ones ask for your
  approval right there in the session (you're present to answer). Headless,
  autonomous sessions are unchanged — they have no one to answer a prompt.

- **Pinned secure floors for bundled dependencies.** `urllib3`, `idna`, and
  `certifi` now carry minimum-version floors so a fresh or cached install can't
  resolve to a version with a known CVE (dependency audit #638). No behavior
  change — existing installs already satisfy the floors.

---

## [v3.0b15] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- **Campaign subsystem** (#549, #556, #559, #600) — Genesis can now run
  autonomous outreach campaigns end to end: scheduled multi-step sequences
  with a Discord webhook adapter and Discord voice pipeline, per-campaign
  profiles, and category validation. Campaigns respect your timezone and
  dedupe so the same target isn't contacted twice.
- **Voice: wake word and proactive speech** (#569, #570, #581) — say
  "hey genesis" to start a conversation hands-free. Genesis can chime
  proactively to get your attention, pre-announce before speaking, and ask
  for approvals out loud with a spoken yes/no.
- **Voice: tool use in conversation** (#580, #590) — the speech-to-speech
  bridge can call Genesis tools mid-conversation, so spoken requests trigger
  real actions instead of just talk.
- **Email thread tracking + autonomous replies** (#565) — Genesis follows
  email conversations as threads and can draft and send replies on its own,
  with weekly-job resilience so long-running threads aren't dropped.
- **Procedural learning** (#591) — Genesis extracts reusable procedures
  from your sessions through a three-stream pipeline, so repeated workflows
  become things it knows how to do rather than re-derives each time.
- **Memory immune system + self-correcting facts** (#545, #552) — memory
  defends against bad or contradictory writes with adversarial review, and a
  supersession chain automatically replaces stale facts with newer ones so
  recall reflects what's currently true.
- **Inbox follow-ups and digests** (#544, #547) — inbox evaluations produce
  structured recommendations, can create tracked follow-ups, and surface a
  digest, with a dashboard filter to focus the queue.
- **Discord polls + morning-report anti-drift** (#560, #562) — Discord
  outreach supports polls, and the morning report carries an anti-drift
  signal to keep autonomous activity aligned with your priorities.

### Fixed

- **Dropping a folder onto the dashboard uploader hung forever** — folder
  drops now upload every file inside, preserving the folder structure under
  the uploads directory. Single-file and multi-file uploads are unchanged.
- **Voice conversations fell a turn behind or got stuck** (#579, #596, #602)
  — fixed a turn-behind bug, stale-session recovery, and the audio path
  after the pipecat 1.3.0 upgrade. Turn-taking is sharper and background
  noise is reduced.
- **Eval quality dashboard could stall** — the nightly memory-scoring job
  now resumes where it left off, scores in parallel within provider rate
  limits, and ignores duplicate judgments, so the compounding-intelligence
  metrics stay accurate and update reliably.
- **Dashboard white flash and file-browser glitches** (#575, #592) — fixed
  a white flash on load, a too-short file browser, post-upload UX, and
  multi-file upload.
- **Scheduled jobs could fire at the wrong time or not at all** (#548, #550,
  #557) — weekly jobs are spread across the week, all jobs use your
  timezone, and interval jobs were converted to cron so they survive restarts
  instead of silently never running.
- **Watchdog falsely reported failure after a slow restart** — it now
  confirms the service is actually back up before reporting, so a successful
  recovery no longer shows as a failed health check.
- **Disk could fill from runaway logs** (#537) — the systemd journal is
  capped at 200MB to prevent disk bloat.
- **Terminal scrollback dropped chunks of output in tmux** — the Claude
  Code pin is now 2.1.173 and the forced-classic-renderer override was
  removed from project settings, so sessions can use the fullscreen renderer
  (`/tui fullscreen`), which keeps the complete conversation scrollable
  in-app and exportable to tmux with `Ctrl+O` then `[`.
- **UI icons rendered as underscores when connecting from Windows** — the
  tmux session launcher now forces a UTF-8 locale and passes `-u`, so the
  Claude Code logo, checkmarks, and prompt glyphs render correctly. Reconnect
  (detach + re-SSH) for the fix to take effect.
- **Install: npm prefix auto-detection** (#606) — the installer detects
  your npm prefix instead of hardcoding `/usr/local`, so setup works across
  more environments.

### Security

- **Removed pickle from the embedding cache** (#536) — the on-disk
  embedding cache now uses JSON instead of pickle, closing a code-execution
  risk from untrusted cache files (CVE-2025-69872).
- **Cleared dependency vulnerabilities in the voice bridge** (#597) ---
  updated the voice bridge lockfile, resolving 44 of 46 flagged dependency
  advisories.

---

## [v3.0b14] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Voice S2S pipeline** (#524, #525, #530, #532, #535) — speech-to-
  speech voice conversations via Wyoming protocol and GPT-Realtime API.
  Includes conciseness nudge, audio output fix, and 30-minute idle
  timeout.
- **Ego notification pipeline** (#531) — proposals deliver through
  outreach with dedup, rate limiting, and quiet hours. Content firewall
  prevents information leakage in dispatched content sessions.
- **Ego domain separation** (#529) — user ego and genesis ego operate
  with distinct information boundaries. Domain-aware realist catches
  cross-domain proposals before delivery.
- **Verified autonomy** (#521, #522) — ECE calibration metric and
  quality scorer for autonomous execution. Adversarial review layer
  validates dispatch outcomes.
- **Dispatch gate** (#516) — ego proposals route through the autonomy
  approval pipeline before execution.
- **Life domain model** (#539) — memory system supports life domain
  tags (employment, personal, genesis). User profile structured around
  life dimensions.
- **Essential knowledge: active work** (#509) — real-time active work
  section in the ego's essential context window.
- **Dashboard contribution toggle** (#533) — contribution offers can
  be enabled or disabled from the dashboard Settings tab.
- **Hook pipeline wiring** (#518) — outcome verification, skill
  injection, and feedback audit connected to the hook system.

### Fixed

- **Ego reactive spinning** (#538) — reactive signal threshold raised
  from WARNING to ERROR, eliminating thousands of noise-driven ego
  cycles per week. Infrastructure escalations filtered from user ego
  context. Dispatch verification fuzzy-matches similar filenames
  instead of false-failing.
- **Contribution hook in worktrees** (#538) — config gate resolves
  from the main repo root instead of the worktree path.
- **Dream cycle OOM** (#517, #528) — entity resolution OOM guard
  prevents unbounded Qdrant searches. Chunked dedup handles large
  memory buckets without memory exhaustion.
- **DeepSeek V4 cost tracking** (#526) — custom cost entries for
  models not in litellm's registry. Dream cycle hardening for edge
  cases.

---

## [v3.0b13] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- **Provider failure escalation** (#512) — circuit breaker trips that
  cycle 5+ times without recovery now auto-create high-priority
  observations. The ego picks them up naturally instead of relying on
  manual investigation. Recovery clears the escalation state.
- **Investigation model override** (#512) — ego proposal dispatches
  respect per-action-type model configuration (`dispatch_model_overrides`
  in ego.yaml). Investigations default to Opus for deeper reasoning.
- **Dashboard circuit breaker visibility** (#512) — LLM provider cards
  in operational vitals show breaker state (OPEN/HALF-OPEN badges),
  trip count, and last failure category.
- **Goal decomposition** (#501) — ego goals support subgoals,
  cascade tracking, goal_type, and cadence scheduling.
- **Goal-driven behavior** (#494) — staleness signals, deep context
  injection, and assessment for ego goal management.
- **Reflection corpus recording** (#503) — captures deep reflection
  observations for quality measurement and prompt optimization.
- **Content validation hooks** (#500) — gitleaks rules and commit-msg
  hook for automated content validation.

### Fixed

- **Surplus restart flooding** (#504) — restart-resilient scheduling
  with completed_at cooldown prevents re-enqueuing on server restart.
  Watchdog heartbeat refresh prevents false staleness detection.
- **Morning report staleness** (#506) — inbox count from DB instead
  of filesystem, observation surfacing lifecycle respected, standing
  items use proper datetime comparison.
- **Ego domain boundaries** (#506) — user ego no longer sees
  infrastructure observations that belong to the Genesis ego's domain.
- **Light reflection duplicates** (#502, #505) — eliminated duplicate
  observations and injected prior context for continuity.
- **Routing config cleanup** (#510) — removed stale model entries
  from routing chains after upstream model availability changes.
- **Bookmark search** (#511) — bookmarks searched via SQL instead
  of memory retriever for reliability.

### Changed

- **Realist gate tightened** (#504) — bypass threshold raised from
  high to critical-only priority.
- **CODEOWNERS + PR discussion** (#508) — require discussion
  before PRs on the public repo.

---

## [v3.0b12.1] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **Reflection quality rubric** (#493) — LLM-as-judge rubric scoring
  deep reflection observations on specificity, actionability, novelty,
  and grounding. Foundation for DSPy prompt optimization. Calibrated at
  98% agreement on 50 hand-graded cases.
- **Golden set generator** — one-shot script to bootstrap rubric
  calibration data from existing deep reflection observations.
- **Standalone calibration runner** — validates the rubric outside the
  full Genesis runtime using a lightweight litellm router wrapper.
- **Voyage AI reranking** (#489) — post-retrieval reranking via
  Voyage rerank-2.5 for memory recall precision.
- **Memory recall defaults** (#492) — rerank enabled by default with
  opt-out for latency-sensitive callers.
- **Ego realist upgrade** (#491) — realist gate now uses Opus with
  domain boundary enforcement.
- **User job timezone fix** (#490) — scheduler respects user timezone
  for job scheduling.
- **Ego CycleType removal** (#486) — legacy run_cycle() enum removed.
- **PageIndex document indexing** (#487) — tree-based vectorless RAG
  for structured PDFs via PageIndex cloud API.
- **Dream cycle entity resolution** (#483) — graph enrichment during
  dream cycles with entity resolution and relationship extraction.

### Fixed

- **CodeQL security alerts** (#485) — resolved all 8 open alerts.

---

## [v3.0b11] - 2026-05-23

48 PRs merged. Proposal lifecycle redesigned — ego's focus board
decoupled from user approval queue. Ego reliability hardened across
resolution UX, realist gate, and sovereignty guards. Reflection goes
event-driven. Dashboard gains observations tab and eval metrics.

### Added

- **Board/queue separation** (#412) — ego's 0-3 focus board is now
  independent of the user's pending approval queue. New `unboard` action
  rotates ego focus without destroying user approvals. 14-day auto-table
  for stale proposals.
- **Unified proposal resolution** (#411) — natural language approval
  ("ok", "yes", "sounds good") recognized across Telegram, MCP tool,
  and CC sessions. Re-validate path for withdrawn proposals.
- **User directives** (#399) — direct instructions to the ego with
  rich goal context and MCP tools for goal/directive management.
- **Goal-proposal linking** (#390, #403) — proposals advance specific
  user goals with progress tracking and Opus-quality dispatch.
- **Critical observation alerting** (#369, #370) — automatic Telegram
  alerts for critical observations with delivery gating and dedup.
- **Observations tab** (#367) — browse and resolve observations on
  the dashboard.
- **J-9 eval metrics** (#378, #383) — evaluation dimensions and
  meta-health heartbeat surfaced on dashboard.
- **Workflow visibility** (#380) — phase timeline with linked
  follow-ups on dashboard.
- **TinyFish Browser API** (#388) — Layer 4 CDP option for browser
  automation.
- **Model assessment framework** (#372) — activated scheduler for
  provider evaluation.
- **Weekly models.md synthesis** (#410) — recon pipeline auto-generates
  model intelligence report.

### Changed

- **Event-driven reflection** (#408) — anomaly focus with delta-only
  Light prompts. No re-reporting known conditions.
- **Silent micro ticks** (#404) — perception runs without LLM unless
  critical signal detected.
- **Jurisdiction separation** (#387) — user ego and genesis ego
  operate in distinct domains.
- **Update polling** — state-based silent-death detection replaces
  wall-clock timeout with 30-second startup grace period.

### Fixed

- **24h sovereignty guard** (#411, #412) — tabling and withdrawal
  blocked for proposals delivered less than 24 hours ago.
- **Realist confabulation** (#412) — realist gate can no longer
  fabricate system state claims from failure patterns in history.
- **Observation TTL tuning** (#407) — infrastructure types expire
  faster to prevent stale belief errors.
- **Ego outcome visibility** (#391) — clear FAILED/OK outcomes in
  proposal history context.
- **Reactive event dedup** (#397) — content-dedup prevents 30-minute
  spam from repeated signals.

- **Sentinel stale heartbeat** (#376) — detects and reports on
  dashboard.
- **Inbox re-evaluation** (#402) — previously evaluated items no
  longer re-processed.
- **Dashboard UX** (#364, #394, #396) — approvals, ego badges, work
  tab, timezone handling, silent-death detection.

---

## [v3.0b10] - 2026-05-15

5 PRs merged. Dream cycle adds retroactive memory consolidation. Ego
proposals show attribution (User vs Genesis). Promoted surplus insights
now feed into deep reflection instead of dead-ending. Guardian hardened
against VM crashes.

### Added

- **Dream cycle** (#359) — retroactive episodic memory consolidation.
  Background process reviews recent memories, identifies clusters and
  patterns, and synthesizes higher-order observations.
- **Ego attribution** (#362) — proposals display which ego (User CEO
  vs Genesis COO) created them, on both Telegram digests and the
  dashboard.
- **Surplus→reflection pipeline** (#362) — promoted surplus insights
  feed into deep reflection context. After routing, insights are marked
  consumed so they don't re-appear.

### Fixed

- **Ego dispatch pipeline** (#358) — timeout handling, double-dispatch
  prevention, and message persistence for proposal execution.
- **Dream cycle safety** (#363) — bucket chunking, memory preflight
  validation, and async yielding to prevent runaway consolidation.
- **Guardian VM crash hardening** (#361) — kernel OOM tuning, MCP
  process isolation, and preflight health checks before diagnosis.

---

## [v3.0b9] - 2026-05-14

54 PRs merged. Ego gains layers 3--6 (realist gate, cross-ego isolation,
capability map, reactive cycles, model tiering). The surplus engine gets
an intelligence intake pipeline. Approval system rebuilt. Memory and
learning subsystems hardened across a dozen fixes. Browser automation
gains stealth and VNC-based Turnstile bypass. CC's Bash sandbox moved
off volatile `/tmp` to prevent intermittent session-breaking failures.

### Added

- **Ego layers 3--6** (#333, #335, #346) — realist gate for proposal
  quality control, cross-ego isolation (user ego and Genesis ego run
  independently), capability map for self-awareness, reactive cycles
  that respond to environmental changes, and model tiering for
  cost-appropriate execution.
- **Intelligence intake pipeline** (#349) — surplus engine atomizes
  incoming intelligence signals, scores them for relevance, and routes
  to the appropriate processing lane.
- **Stealth browser skill** (#338) — VNC trusted-input technique for
  bypassing anti-bot protections like Cloudflare Turnstile.
- **VNC Turnstile auto-bypass** (#348) — wires VNC trusted input into
  the browser automation layer for hands-free CAPTCHA solving.
- **Medium self-healing login** (#342) — `MediumDistributor` recovers
  from expired sessions without manual intervention.
- **Ego Opus dispatch** (#347) — interact-profile sessions use Opus
  for higher-quality output.
- **Voice-master quick mode** (#341) — lightweight voice application
  with anti-AI audit rules.
- **Ego publish profile type** (#339) — adds `publish` to the interact
  profile types for content distribution dispatch.
- **Evolution proposal review tool** (#316) — MCP tool for triaging
  ego proposals.
- **DB migration auto-apply at startup** (#302) — pending migrations
  run automatically on server start.
- **Memory lifecycle GC** (#352) — garbage collection for
  `pending_embeddings`, events rotation, and `retrieved_count` tracking.

### Changed

- **Automated-subsystem memory writes no longer get embedded into
  Qdrant.** Ego corrections, triage signals, and reflection
  observations now land in SQLite (`memory_metadata` + FTS5) only.
  They were already filtered out of foreground recall by default
  (see prior changelog entry); the only paths that surface them are
  explicit opt-ins (`only_subsystem=...` or `include_subsystem=...`),
  and those work via FTS5 keyword search — no Qdrant vector index
  needed. This avoids paying ongoing embedding + storage cost for
  capability that has no live consumer. New writes never touch
  Qdrant; the included one-off script
  `scripts/cleanup_subsystem_qdrant.py` (dry-run by default) cleans
  legacy points from existing installs.

### Fixed

- **`memory_metadata.invalid_at` is now actually honored at recall
  time.** The bitemporal "fact stopped being true at X" column was
  schema-only since the v3.0a bitemporal migration — writes were
  possible (`invalidate_memory()`) but recall never read the value.
  Recall now always filters `invalid_at IS NULL OR invalid_at > now()`
  across FTS5, Qdrant, and drift paths. Rows past their expiry no
  longer surface. Backwards-compatible: every legacy row has NULL
  `invalid_at`, which passes the filter unchanged.
- **Observation TTL now applies to the dual-write memory copy.**
  `ObservationWriter` propagates each observation's `expires_at` as
  `invalid_at` on the linked `memory_metadata` row. Previously the
  observation expired from the `observations` table (via the
  scheduled `resolve_expired` sweep) but its embedded MemoryStore
  copy persisted forever — silently leaking expired content into
  recall under the few code paths that bypassed default filtering.

### Added

- **Procedure auto-extraction now fires on SUCCESS outcomes from
  autonomous channels.** Previously the triage pipeline only extracted
  procedures from `APPROACH_FAILURE` and `WORKAROUND_SUCCESS` outcomes,
  so the procedural_memory table grew only from rare failure patterns.
  Successful autonomous task completions (`inbox`, `mail`, `reflection`,
  `surplus` channels) now also drive extraction, giving the system a
  baseline pattern for the next run of the same task type. Foreground
  SUCCESS is intentionally NOT auto-extracted — foreground procedures
  are user-initiated via the `procedure_store` MCP.
- **Procedure novelty gate.** Auto-extracted procedures are now
  compared against existing procedures of the same `task_type` via
  cosine similarity of their `principle` embeddings. If the new
  principle is ≥0.85 similar to an existing one, storage is skipped.
  Prevents the table from filling with paraphrases of the same insight
  as SUCCESS-path extraction broadens the trigger surface. Fail-open
  when the embedding stack is unavailable.
- **Proactive procedure recall hook.** Procedures now surface
  automatically on every CC prompt — same UserPromptSubmit pathway as
  the proactive memory hook. The hook reuses the prompt embedding the
  memory hook already computes, compares it against `principle_embedding`
  BLOBs stored on each procedure row, and emits a single
  `[Procedure | task_type | id:xxx]` line when the top match's cosine
  ≥ 0.7. Top-1 only — most prompts won't surface a procedure. New
  `principle_embedding` column on `procedural_memory` (forward-only;
  pre-existing rows store NULL and are skipped until they're
  re-extracted or re-taught). Effectively replaces the manual
  `procedure_recall`-before-multi-step-tasks reminder in CLAUDE.md.
- **Four user-work wings added to the memory taxonomy:** `dev_workflow`,
  `research`, `integrations`, and `career`. Previously the taxonomy only
  modelled Genesis-internal subsystems (memory, learning, routing,
  infrastructure, channels, autonomy), so all user-domain memories
  (git/PR/CI activity, paper reading, third-party API integrations,
  career and job-search work) collapsed into `general/uncategorized`.
  New keyword and tag rules route the obvious cases; the long tail
  will still land in `general` until reclassified. The Genesis-internal
  `provider` tag still routes to `routing`, not `integrations` —
  user-work integrations come in via specific service names (minimax,
  abacus, litellm, etc.).
- **Foreground recall excludes automated-subsystem content by
  default.** Memory writes from ego corrections, triage signals, and
  reflection observations are now tagged with a new
  `source_subsystem` column. By default, `memory_recall` MCP, the
  internal `HybridRetriever.recall()`, drift recall, and the
  UserPromptSubmit proactive-memory hook all filter these rows out
  so they don't pollute user-facing answers with the system's own
  decisional commentary. Two new opt-in parameters expose the tagged
  content: `include_subsystem` augments the default set
  (`include_subsystem=True` returns everything;
  `include_subsystem=["ego"]` adds ego writes alongside user
  content), and `only_subsystem` flips into subsystem-only mode
  (`only_subsystem="ego"` returns just ego corrections, for ego's
  own self-recall). Migration 0016 backfills `reflection` for
  existing rows tagged with `reflection_observation` /
  `reflection_summary` in FTS5. Other subsystems are tagged
  forward-only on new writes.
- **LLM-as-judge eval primitive** — new `LLMJudgeScorer`
  (`ScorerType.LLM_JUDGE`), versioned `Rubric` registry, and a
  calibration job that grades a rubric against a hand-graded golden
  set and refuses to promote it below 80% agreement. The judge runs
  through a new `judge` call site in `config/model_routing.yaml`
  (DeepSeek V4 Pro via OpenRouter), so cost, fallback, and circuit
  breakers come for free. First rubric:
  `memory_recall_grounding`. The primitive is the foundation for
  follow-on CRAG retrieval grading and ego eval-drift work; nothing
  in the live runtime calls it yet, so this update is plumbing only
  for now.

### Changed

- **Procedure extraction routes to stronger models.** The
  `38_procedure_extraction` call site chain is now
  `cerebras-qwen` (Qwen 3 235B, free) →
  `openrouter-deepseek-v4` (V4 Pro, paid) →
  `groq-free` (Llama 3.3 70B). Mistral Large and Gemini Flash are
  dropped — Mistral underperformed for this synthesis task and Gemini
  Flash is too small. DeepSeek V4 Pro is enabled via `default_paid:
  true`; at the realistic event-driven frequency of this call site,
  the spend is negligible.
- **`judge` call site is in the L2 / tmp-pressure-high skip lists**
  — when Genesis is degraded or disk-pressured, judge calls back
  off automatically, in line with the existing rules for non-critical
  background work.
- **Confusable call-site IDs renamed.** Three IDs previously shared
  overloaded descriptors that made the routing config ambiguous in
  the neural monitor and source code:
  `17_fresh_eyes_review` → `17_executor_review` (executor Gate 2),
  `23_fresh_eyes_review` → `23_outreach_review` (outreach pre-send),
  `email_triage` → `outreach_email_triage`. If you reference these
  IDs in custom routing config, an eval CLI invocation, or a dashboard
  bookmark, update to the new names. Migration `0015_rename_confusable_call_sites`
  renames existing rows in `call_site_last_run` and `deferred_work_queue`
  at server start; historical `cost_events.metadata` entries are left
  as-written.

### Fixed

- **Outcome classifier no longer silently claims SUCCESS on parse
  failure.** When the LLM response was unparseable, the classifier
  previously returned `OutcomeClass.SUCCESS`, which let bad runs
  silently update autonomy weights and skip procedure extraction.
  Failed classifications now return a dedicated `CLASSIFICATION_FAILED`
  sentinel; the learning pipeline detects it after the classifier call
  and skips downstream learning (delta assessment, attribution
  routing, procedure extraction, steering rule capture) instead of
  proceeding with phantom success. The sentinel renames the internal
  `OutcomeClass.UNKNOWN` value to make its role as an error marker
  explicit (it was never a real 6th outcome category, just a fallback
  bucket).
- **Triage pipeline no longer crashes silently in procedure extraction.**
  The procedure extraction block referenced `summary.output_text`, which
  is not a field on `InteractionSummary` — the correct field is
  `response_text`. The `AttributeError` was caught by the surrounding
  exception handler, so the bug was invisible at runtime but blocked
  every auto-extraction. Same fix applied to the behavioral correction
  recorder (BIS).
- **Call sites with no API key stay visible on the dashboard.**
  Previously, a call site whose entire provider chain had no API key
  configured was silently dropped from `cfg.call_sites` at startup,
  making it invisible everywhere (dashboard, routing API, health
  snapshot). On a partially-configured install (some keys set, some
  empty) you couldn't tell which call sites were unreachable or what
  you needed to add. Keyless providers now stay registered with
  `has_api_key=False`; the router skips them at routing time exactly
  the way it skips a tripped circuit breaker, and the neural monitor
  shows the call site with a red **NO API KEY CONFIGURED** badge plus
  a banner naming the env vars (`API_KEY_<TYPE>`) that would enable
  it. Partial API-key configuration is the normal install state, not
  a bug — it should be discoverable. Sentinel does not alert on
  these sites (existing filter for `wired:False`/`disabled`/no
  `last_run_at` covers it).
- **Approval system overhauled** (#323, #329, #351) — removes
  subsystem scoping, adds instant wake on approval, startup recovery
  for pending approvals, and staleness guard for approvals blocking the
  inbox monitor indefinitely.
- **Ego self-suppression eliminated** (#331) — removes root causes
  of ego cycles suppressing their own output, plus fixes deep reflection
  floor bug.
- **Sentinel alarm flapping cooldown** (#340) — 15-minute cooldown
  prevents repeated alarm/clear cycles from spamming notifications.
  Adds `MemAvailable` metric.
- **CC Bash sandbox moved off volatile `/tmp`** (#357) — sets
  `CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR` to persistent disk (`~/.genesis/cc-tmp`),
  eliminating intermittent ENOENT failures that broke the Bash tool
  for 7+ sessions.
- **Inbox startup wake delay** (#354, #355) — uses
  `asyncio.call_later` for reliable startup wake instead of immediate
  wake that raced with event loop bootstrap.
- **Migration 0017 transaction fix** (#350) — removes erroneous
  `db.commit()` since the migration runner manages transactions.
- **Inbox content hash normalization** (#330) — prevents duplicate
  processing. Strengthens YouTube fallback instructions.
- **Learning pipeline structural fixes** (#332) — 5 fixes for the
  procedural learning pipeline.
- **Memory tagging and recall fixes** (#324, #325, #326, #327) ---
  separate episodic/knowledge stores, Qdrant collection tagging, drift
  null safety, CBM hook, and curated KB migration.
- **Contribution gate force-with-lease** (#320) — explicit expected
  SHA prevents accidental overwrites.
- **Cloud-only install Ollama exclusion** (#328) — `probe_ollama`
  excluded from critical failure on cloud-only installs.
- **Runtime config path fix** (#344) — corrects config path in
  runtime/init modules.
- **Surplus operational fixes** (#343) — zombie approvals, backup
  verification, failure visibility.
- **Surplus cognitive context enrichment** (#345) — enriches task
  context for higher-quality surplus output.

### Migrations

- **0014_eval_results_metadata** — adds `metadata_json` to
  `eval_results` for structured judge output.
- **0015_rename_confusable_call_sites** — renames overloaded call-site
  IDs in `call_site_last_run` and `deferred_work_queue`.
- **0016_source_subsystem** — backfills `source_subsystem` column on
  `memory_metadata` for subsystem content filtering.
- **0017_ego_tables** — ego world model, proposal, and session tables.

---

## [v3.0b8] - 2026-05-09

A late-day batch focused on web intelligence, ego self-regulation, and
operational hygiene. TinyFish becomes a first-class web-tools backend,
ego learns to back off when the user is absent, and the surplus surface
gains an autonomous research pipeline.

### Added

- **TinyFish web tools provider** (#292) — new `web_search`,
  `web_fetch`, and `web_agent` adapters under `genesis.providers`.
  TinyFish is the new primary in `web_search` / `web_fetch` auto chains
  (gated on `API_KEY_TINYFISH`), with SearXNG / Brave / Scrapling /
  Crawl4AI retained as fallbacks. `web_fetch` gains a `urls` parameter
  for parallel multi-URL retrieval (1--10 URLs).
- **Anticipatory research pipeline** (#291) — 2-step pipeline
  generating search queries from observation context and synthesizing
  TinyFish-fetched results with source URLs, scheduled every 12h via
  the analytical lane.
- **`SELF_UNBLOCK` brainstorm category** (#291) — third daily
  brainstorm alongside `BRAINSTORM_USER` and `BRAINSTORM_SELF`,
  focused on identifying internal blockers Genesis can clear without
  user input.
- **User-recency cadence tiers for ego** (#287) — ego's max
  cycle interval now adapts to time-since-last-foreground-session
  (5 tiers from 240m at <24h to 4320m at >14d). Adaptive backoff still
  operates within each tier; only the ceiling moves.

### Changed

- **Ego output contracts now include `communication_decision`** (#286)
  — both user and Genesis ego JSON contracts now expose the
  `send_digest` / `stay_quiet` / `urgent_notify` field that was
  previously described in narrative only. The default flips from
  `stay_quiet` to `send_digest`, so proposals are no longer silently
  swallowed when the field is omitted.
- **MCP code-intelligence tools auto-upgrade on install/bootstrap**
  (#299) — `scripts/bootstrap.sh` and `scripts/install.sh` now re-run
  the codebase-memory-mcp installer unconditionally (idempotent, pulls
  latest) and call `uv tool upgrade serena-agent` when Serena is
  already present. Existing installs get the latest versions on the
  next bootstrap; fresh installs are unchanged. GitNexus is
  intentionally left on its prerelease channel.

### Fixed

- **Mergeable check actually fires now** (#290) — the
  UNKNOWN/CONFLICTING block from PR #270 lived in
  `bash_safety_hook.sh`, which was never wired into `settings.json`.
  Moved the check into the actually-deployed `git_push_guard.py`, so
  `gh pr merge` now hard-blocks on UNKNOWN or CONFLICTING mergeable
  status.

---

## [v3.0b7] - 2026-05-09

Ego gets two new self-awareness features, references move into the
episodic graph, and Opus 4.7's xhigh effort tier becomes a first-class
option.

### Added

- **Ego causal intervention journal** (#284) — every proposal now
  tracks its lifecycle (proposed → approved/rejected → executed →
  outcome) in a queryable journal. Ego can correlate decisions with
  outcomes to learn from past judgments.
- **Ego self-model capability map** (#288) — Genesis maintains a
  live capability inventory aggregated from MCP tools, channels,
  modules, and memory wings. Ego references this when proposing
  actions to avoid suggesting things it can't do.
- **Email outbound channel** (#289) — Genesis can now send email
  via the configured outbound provider. Third outreach lane alongside
  Telegram and dashboard.
- **GitHub star tracking** (#289) — recon source captures
  GENesis-AGI repo stargazer activity. Surfaces in morning reports.
- **xhigh effort tier** (#297) — Claude Code 2.1.111's xhigh tier
  for Opus 4.7 is now recognized everywhere Genesis hands off effort
  level (CC invoker, Telegram `/effort`, `session_set_effort` MCP,
  dashboard). Defaults remain at `high`; xhigh is opt-in.
- **Morning report observations** (#285) — recent unresolved
  observations are surfaced alongside the usual morning digest, so
  operators see what Genesis is paying attention to.
- **Follow-up retention cleanup** (#293) — completed and failed
  follow-ups older than 30 days are now purged daily at 02:30 UTC.
  Pinned items are preserved.

### Changed

- **Reference storage migrates to episodic memory** (#296) — 52
  reference vectors move from `knowledge_base` to `episodic_memory`
  via SQLite migration 0013 + Qdrant init-time migration (idempotent).
  References now surface naturally via all memory recall paths.
  `reference_lookup` continues to work; only the storage collection
  changed.
- **Disk alert threshold** (#295) — `health_alerts` now fires
  WARNING at <15% free disk (was CRITICAL-only at <10%). The 10–15%
  gap is no longer a blind spot.

### Fixed

- **Ego self-reinforcing holdback loop** (#283) — ego could spiral
  into withdrawing its own proposals based on its own prior
  decisions. The holdback heuristic now considers proposal age and
  user signal correctly.
- **Heartbeat cleanup not wired** (#281) — subsystem heartbeats
  weren't being aged out, leaving stale records in the dashboard.
- **Surplus task double-enqueue** (#281) — `active_by_type` check
  now matches the dispatch loop's filter, so scheduled surplus jobs
  don't double-enqueue.
- **Outreach metric mislabels** (#289) — corrected mislabeled
  outreach counters in the dashboard.

---

## [v3.0b6] - 2026-05-09

Memory retrieval gets faster graph traversal, explicit drift control,
and better observability.

### Added

- **NetworkX graph engine** (#279) — in-memory graph over 43K+ memory
  links replaces recursive SQL queries. Enables centrality scoring and
  shortest-path queries. Falls back to SQL if NetworkX is unavailable.
- **DRIFT retrieval mode** (#279) — `memory_recall` gains a `mode`
  parameter: `"auto"` (default, unchanged behavior), `"standard"`
  (no drift fallback), `"drift"` (direct 3-phase retrieval).
- **Recall instrumentation** (#279) — every `memory_recall` call now
  logs which pipeline was used (standard, drift, auto→drift) for
  retrieval quality analysis.

### Fixed

- **Knowledge re-ingestion creates duplicates** (#279) — the
  orchestrator now uses idempotent upsert with stale Qdrant cleanup
  instead of raw insert. Re-ingesting a URL no longer creates orphaned
  vectors.
- **DB resilience** (#273) — awareness tick survives transient SQLite
  connection failures with automatic recovery and alert deduplication.

### Changed

- **Dashboard call site badges** (#278) — parallelization indicator
  shows which call sites run concurrently.
- **Routing updates** (#274, #277) — DeepSeek V4 Flash added, GLM 5.1
  renamed, call site descriptions added to routing config.

---

## [v3.0b5] - 2026-05-07

Sentinel gets smarter, ego learns its boundaries, and a cascade of
observation spam gets silenced at the source.

### Changed

- **Sentinel upgraded to Opus** (#245) — the container-side health
  guardian now runs on the strongest available model. Both Sentinel and
  Guardian prompts gain planning directives, tenacity rules, known
  pitfalls from production incidents, and live operational context
  injection from essential knowledge.
- **Ego domain boundaries** (#248) — User Ego no longer tracks
  operational costs or opines on config values. Genesis Ego stays in its
  infrastructure lane. Both egos receive explicit rules separating user
  career goals from Genesis marketing goals.

### Fixed

- **Observation spam eliminated** (#248) — micro-reflection dedup
  was hashing LLM-generated summary text, which varies each tick. Now
  hashes structural properties (tags, anomaly flag, signal names).
  Stops the 21+ duplicate `user_goal_staleness` observations per day.
- **Approval gate restored** (#245) — PR #240 accidentally set the
  live config to `manual_approval_required: false`. Fixed with
  three-layer config separation: code default (True, safe fallback),
  repo YAML (false, friction-free installs), local overlay (user
  preference, gitignored).
- **Telegram polling reconnected** (#245) — adapter_v2 was stuck in
  a stall loop (26 consecutive 900s stalls). Server restart
  reinitialized the connection cleanly.
- **Files tab fills viewport** (#245) — the 1400px max-width
  constraint lifts when the Files tab is active. File content viewer
  now resizable in both directions (#247).
- **Download button visible** (#245) — enlarged with text label.

### Removed

- **CC version watcher deactivated** (#248) — the automatic Claude
  Code update signal was generating noise. Genesis version watcher
  (upstream update detection) stays active.

### Infrastructure

- **Ubuntu/noble portability** (#248) — `scripts/host-setup.sh` now
  accepts `GENESIS_CONTAINER_IMAGE` env var override instead of
  hardcoding `images:ubuntu/noble`.

---

## [v3.0b4] - 2026-05-06

Settings get a proper overhaul, ego recovers from a multi-day deadlock,
and memory recall learns to try harder when results are thin.

### Added

- **Dashboard PWA support** (#242) — manifest + service worker make
  the dashboard installable as a standalone mobile app. Memory tab gains
  a 30-day growth sparkline and wing distribution badges.
- **File download** (#232) — Files tab gets a download button with
  50MB cap, path traversal protection, and symlink-aware security.
- **Drift recall fallback** (#233) — when `memory_recall` returns
  sparse results (<3), the 3-phase drift retrieval algorithm
  (global scan → cluster drill-down → weighted RRF) fires automatically.
  Silent degradation on failure.
- **Query term expansion** (#234) — `expand_query_terms` parameter
  exposed on the `memory_recall` MCP tool, enabling tag co-occurrence
  query expansion for ambiguous searches.

### Changed

- **Settings consolidation** (#240) — all per-subsystem timezone
  fields replaced by `genesis.env.user_timezone()`. Dashboard settings
  tab gets domain ordering, expanded form domains, and descriptions
  for all 18 settings groups.
- **Inbox retry dedup** (#243) — scanner reuses existing failed rows
  instead of creating duplicates on retry. CC invoker captures stderr
  on timeout for diagnostics. Evaluation timeout raised to 900s.

### Fixed

- **Ego deadlock** (#241) — approval blocks no longer trip the circuit
  breaker (new `CycleBlockedError` exception). Approval requests get
  timeouts (1h CLI, 2h sentinel). Telegram proposals split at 4096 chars
  instead of failing silently. Proposal field truncation limits raised
  4–5x.

---

## [v3.0b3] - 2026-05-05

Web tools get MCP exposure so background sessions and subagents can
actually use them. Ego proposals flow through approval correctly.
SSH dispatch enables cross-machine module communication.

### Added

- **SSH IPC adapter** (#225) — external modules can now dispatch
  prompts to remote Claude Code instances over SSH. Two modes: CC
  (structured JSON) and SHELL (raw commands). Enables module
  communication without standing up HTTP services.
- **Protected paths guard** (#226) — PreToolUse hook blocks accidental
  deletion of session transcripts, backups, snapshots, browser profiles,
  and the production database.

### Changed

- **Web tools exposed via MCP** (#229) — `web_fetch` and `web_search`
  are now MCP tools on genesis-health, making Scrapling, Crawl4AI,
  SearXNG, and the paid search backends accessible to background
  sessions, ego, and subagents (previously required Bash/Python imports).
  Behavioral nudges steer sessions toward these over CC's built-in
  WebFetch/WebSearch.
- **Ego proposal flow** (#228) — proposals now route through the
  approval gate correctly. Auto-promote removed; all proposals require
  explicit approval before execution.
- **Sentinel alarm clearing** (#227) — auto-clear fires only when the
  specific pending alarm resolves, not all alarms indiscriminately.
- **Temp file conventions** (#226) — `~/tmp/` documented as the
  standard transient path. `/tmp/` (512MB tmpfs) is off-limits.

### Fixed

- **Migration runner compatibility** (#230) — migration 0010 handles
  databases that lack the `memory_metadata` table (test fixtures, fresh
  installs before DDL runs).
- **Dashboard memory bar** — uses correct anonymization percentage for
  status assessment.
- **Drift recall and step dispatcher** — critical bugs in recall
  query, bi-temporal column migration, and dispatcher routing.

---

## [v3.0b2] - 2026-05-03

Ego becomes perceptive, task execution gets smarter about blockers, and
Genesis can now bootstrap code intelligence tools on fresh machines.
Seventeen PRs landed — a mix of new capabilities, reliability fixes, and
documentation that reflects what the system actually is.

### Added

- **Ego memory surfacing** (#207) — the ego now pulls relevant memories
  before proposing actions, grounds proposals in evidence, and flags
  recurring observation patterns (Hapax-style proactive discovery).
- **Planning-first direct sessions** (#207) — background CC sessions
  receive a planning instruction so they structure work before executing.
- **Voice identity layer** (#207) — `VOICE.md` defines output taste
  (tone, rhythm, vocabulary) injected into content generation and ego
  sessions.
- **Deep research for task blockers** (#216) — when the task executor
  hits an unresolvable blocker, it spawns a deep-research session and
  uses the findings to construct an exit gate, rather than spinning.
- **Architecture Decision Records** (#217) — seven ADRs documenting
  load-bearing choices (ego ephemeral sessions, surplus routing, memory
  wings, no silent timeouts, router dead-letter, LLM-first judgment).
- **Memory DRIFT recall** (#217) — bi-temporal columns on memory
  metadata enable time-aware retrieval and staleness detection.
- **Medium distribution** (#210) — publish to Medium via Camoufox
  browser automation with voice-calibrated formatting.
- **Code intelligence bootstrap** (#222) — `bootstrap.sh` and
  `install.sh` now install and configure codebase-memory-mcp, GitNexus,
  and Serena automatically on fresh machines. Includes MCP registration
  and initial indexing.
- **Architecture deep-dives and case studies** (#213) — three
  subsystem deep-dives (routing, memory, autonomy) and four case studies
  showing Genesis in practice.
- **Positioning and taxonomy docs** (#217) — "Genesis vs. CLAUDE.md"
  differentiator and the Four C's external vocabulary.

### Changed

- **Approval staleness guard** (#208) — stale approval records are now
  pruned on each cycle. Infrastructure monitor respects disable flag.
- **Ego interact profile expanded** (#215) — the interact safety
  profile now permits content publishing dispatch.
- **README primitives section** (#223) — updated to reflect
  genesis-router and genesis-memory as the two extractable libraries.

### Fixed

- **Surplus scoring collapse** (#209) — scoring function no longer
  collapses to zero when all candidates tie. Watchgod /tmp protection
  and surplus routing corrected.
- **Telegram polling** (#211) — retry logic on polling timeout,
  reduced alert noise from transient failures, morning report
  completeness improved.
- **Knowledge source pipeline default** (#206) — new knowledge sources
  default to `knowledge_ingest` pipeline instead of `recon`.
- **Browser keystroke typing** (#221) — CDP remote sessions now type
  per-keystroke instead of bulk-setting input values, fixing sites that
  validate on keypress.
- **CI stability** (#219) — fixed lint errors (unused imports,
  f-string prefixes), duplicate migration prefix detection, and test
  isolation for migration runner.
- **STEERING.md write protection** (#214) — autonomous learning
  pipelines can no longer modify steering rules without user approval.

---

## [v3.0b1] - 2026-05-01

First beta. The ego subsystem---Genesis's autonomous decision-making
layer---is stable and public. Two egos (User Ego and Genesis Ego) run on
adaptive cadence, propose actions via Telegram, and execute approved work
autonomously. The reflection pipeline now feeds both egos balanced
context instead of flooding one with infrastructure noise.

### Added

- **Ego module** (#26, #27) — two autonomous egos with ephemeral
  sessions, model selection, proposal board, and tiered execution.
  User Ego (CEO, Opus) focuses on user goals; Genesis Ego (COO, Sonnet)
  handles system health. Both dispatch CC sessions with approval gates.
- **Reflection rebalancing** (#196) — observations now carry relevance
  tags (`:user`, `:genesis`, `:both`). Each ego sees what it needs
  instead of everything. Two new signal collectors track user goal
  staleness and session activity patterns.
- **Ego context enrichment** (#205) — User Ego now sees an activity
  pulse (goal staleness, session rhythm, conversation count), model
  freshness warnings, and backlog depth (inbox, recon, follow-ups).
  Genesis Ego gets signal trend arrows across ticks. Both egos see
  recent proposal outcomes for self-calibration.
- **Sequential task execution** (#193) — tasks execute one at a time
  with per-step approval skipping for trusted subsystems.
- **Task intake gate** (#199) — SQLite trigger rejects malformed task
  submissions before they reach the executor.
- **Pinned follow-ups** (#185) — follow-up items can be pinned so they
  survive batch resolution.

### Changed

- **Approval gate redesign** (#198) — stable approval keys for
  recurring dispatches (ego cycles, inbox evaluation). One approval per
  request, no reuse of stale approvals. Pass 3 content-blind matching
  removed entirely.
- **Repetitive micro reflections reduced** (#195) — consecutive
  identical micro observations are suppressed.

### Fixed

- **Genesis Ego crash** (#198) — `signals_json` stored as a list, not
  a dict. Every genesis ego cycle hit `AttributeError` on `.items()`.
- **Approval notifications** (#29) — per-tick notifications are now
  idempotent; duplicate approvals filtered (#33).
- **Executor worktree persistence** (#188) — worktree paths survive
  server restarts.
- **Dashboard memory gauge** (#202) — displays anonymous memory
  percentage instead of used percentage.
- **Resilience metrics** (#201) — correct memory metric source, /tmp
  pressure axis, phantom L2 autonomy level.
- **Ego dashboard controls** (#192) — column names, model override,
  budget cap fixes.

---

## [v3.0a11] - 2026-04-28

Guardian auto-sync, task executor maturity, ego module. Themes:
**autonomous execution**, **adversarial verification**, **cognitive
architecture**, and **host VM self-maintenance**.

### Added

- **Guardian auto-sync** (#168, #169, #170, #171) — host VM Guardian now
  stays automatically in sync with container updates. When you update
  Genesis, changed Guardian-relevant code is pushed to the host via SSH.
  Drift detection alerts within 15 minutes if sync fails silently.
  No more manual SSH to update Guardian code.
- **Ego module** (#182) — autonomous decision-making cycle with cadence
  management, proposal board, context assembly (user + Genesis + system),
  and session dispatch. Dashboard route for ego status.
- **LinkedIn distribution** (#182) — content delivery via Composio SDK
  with OAuth2. Graceful degradation when unconfigured. Optional
  `[distribution]` dependency.
- **Typed module config schema** (#167) — `ConfigField` dataclass with
  type/min/max/required/sensitive metadata. `ModuleBase` mixin for
  zero-boilerplate config. Auto-discovery for new modules without YAML.
  Dashboard widget fix: correct input types for all field kinds.
- **Session intent trail** (#179) — detects topic pivots via keyword
  similarity, injects `[Session trail] topic → topic → ...` into every
  prompt so conversation flow survives compaction.
- **Task executor pipeline** (#177) — tool-capable adversarial
  verification with Codex, recovery resume for interrupted tasks.
- **Sentinel rejection test coverage** (#166) — 6 tests verifying the
  24-hour dispatch suppression window after user rejection.

### Changed

- **Decomposer uses CC invoker** (#181) — task decomposition now uses
  CC invoker (Sonnet) instead of route_call. Falls back to route_call
  if invoker unavailable.
- **Adversarial review runs in worktree** (#183) — Codex and CC invoker
  verification now execute in the task's worktree directory, not the
  repo root. Fixup steps receive the original plan content and longer
  feedback (2000 chars, up from 500).
- **Browser concurrency safety** (#166) — all 7 interaction tools now
  acquire a lock before accessing shared page state.

### Fixed

- **Blocked tasks resume on approval** (#178) — dispatcher polls for
  approved-but-unconsumed approvals on blocked tasks, re-dispatching
  without requiring a server restart.
- **Dispatcher dedup guard** (#181) — tasks reset to PENDING are
  re-dispatchable without server restart.
- **Plan path tilde expansion** (#178) — `expanduser()` on plan paths.
- **PENDING→FAILED transition** (#178) — tasks that fail before REVIEWING
  no longer get stuck in PENDING forever.
- **Concurrent session contamination** (#173) — raw user messages from
  other sessions no longer appear in concurrent session tags.
- **Observability gaps** (#165) — `exc_info=True` on timeout-path log
  calls; replaced `contextlib.suppress(Exception)` with logged warnings.
- **Update subprocess logging** (#165) — direct update and CC tier
  spawning now log to `~/.genesis/` instead of /dev/null.

### Upgrade notes

**Existing users with Guardian on a host VM:** One-time bootstrap required
to enable auto-sync. Run on your **host VM** (not the container):

```bash
cd ~/.local/share/genesis-guardian
incus exec genesis -- tar -cf - -C /home/ubuntu/genesis \
    src/ scripts/ pyproject.toml config/guardian-claude.md | tar -xf -
cp scripts/guardian-gateway.sh ~/.local/bin/guardian-gateway.sh
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/guardian-gateway.sh
systemctl --user restart genesis-guardian.timer
```

Or: `bash scripts/install_guardian.sh --non-interactive`

After this one-time step, all future updates are automatic.

## [v3.0a10] - 2026-04-24

31-commit release. Themes: **multi-step surplus pipelines**, **browser
stealth**, and **reflection quality**.

### Added

- **Surplus pipeline engine** (#147, #149) — deterministic multi-step
  task chains for analytical work. Each step runs on free-tier models;
  the pipeline mechanically advances between steps. First pipeline:
  prompt effectiveness review (catalog call sites, sample outputs,
  evaluate and recommend improvements).
- **Follow-up management** (#146) — `follow_up_update` MCP tool for
  modifying tracked follow-up items.
- **Browser stealth layer 2** (#128) — humanized mouse movements, typing
  cadence, click randomization, and CAPTCHA escalation for automated
  browser sessions.
- **CDP remote backend** (#135) — drive a real Chrome browser over
  Tailscale instead of running headless locally.

### Changed

- **Reflection quality improvements** (#123, #127, #139) — identity
  context for API reflection path, surplus decoupled from reflection
  engine, sentinel recovery wiring, light cognitive state, frequency
  tuning, and NOMINAL quality gate for infrastructure monitoring.
- **Browser reliability** (#126, #133, #134) — always-headed mode, hard
  timeouts, keyboard fallback, ambiguous selector guard, noVNC scaling
  fix.

### Fixed

- **Database write serialization** (#141) — prevents permanent connection
  lock when concurrent writes collide on aiosqlite.
- **Dashboard scroll restoration** (#124) — mouse wheel scrolling works
  on all pages again.
- **Sentinel dashboard indicator** (#130) — yellow indicator for approval
  states plus CI skip markers.
- **Safety fixes** (#136) — surplus test hardening, morning report idle
  filter, sentinel re-verify.

### Removed

- **Infrastructure monitor schedule** — removed from surplus cron.
  Produced noise (459 insights, 1 promotion). Returns as a focused
  "monitor the monitors" pipeline in a future release.

---

## [v3.0a9] - 2026-04-22

7-commit release. Themes: **background session spawner**, **content
pipeline**, **browser reliability**, and **outreach fixes**.

### Added

- **Direct session spawner** (#118, #121) — spawn profile-constrained
  background CC sessions via `direct_session_run` MCP tool. Three safety
  profiles (observe, interact, research) control what each session can do.
  DB-backed dispatch queue ensures sessions outlive the calling session.
- **Content pipeline activation** (#117) — content module wired into
  outreach system with CONTENT category for multi-platform publishing.
- **Browser process hygiene** (#115) — idle timeout (1h auto-cleanup),
  orphan process detection, background reaper for stuck browser processes.

### Changed

- **Browser stale context recovery** (#116) — detects dead browser pages
  and transparently reconnects. Session history tracking and VNC
  environment improvements.

### Fixed

- **Outreach pipeline** (#122) — approval reuse, alert routing, surplus
  topic handling, staleness decay. Fixes pre-existing test failures in
  cognitive state rendering.

---

## [v3.0a8] - 2026-04-21

21-commit release. Themes: **knowledge dashboard UX**, **browser
automation upgrade**, **cross-session awareness**, and **CI/security
hardening**.

### Added

- **Knowledge dashboard overhaul** (#104) — in-page confirm modals
  (immune to browser dialog blocking), drag-drop file upload, processing
  mode toggle (extract vs store-as-is), parallel distillation pipeline
  (4x concurrent), and crash recovery for stuck uploads.
- **File modification audit trail** (#109) — PostToolUse hook records all
  Write/Edit operations with session ID, file path, and file hash. Query
  "what session modified this file?" in one SQL call.
- **Browser collaborative mode** (#107) — side-panel extension for
  real-time observation of automated browser sessions.
- **Cross-session awareness** (#97) — awareness loop now tracks
  observations across sessions with TTL-based hygiene.
- **Output safety convention** (#112) — pre-commit hook warns when
  non-code files are staged, directing to `~/.genesis/output/`.

### Changed

- **Camoufox as primary browser** (#108) — anti-fingerprint browser now
  default for all automation. Chromium available as fallback.
- **Neural monitor grid redesign** (#106) — reorganized dashboard grid
  layout for better information density.
- **Proactive memory enrichment** (#95, #96) — hook results now include
  age, wing, and ID for expand-without-re-search. Limits bumped to
  300/200 chars with smart sentence truncation.
- **Cerebras-Qwen routing** (#104) — promoted to 6 call site chains
  (3 primary, 3 fallback) for surplus and knowledge workloads.
- **Sweep infrastructure** (#98, #102) — provider registry cleanup, MCP
  audit, CLAUDE.md compression.

### Fixed

- **CI test suite** (#110) — resolved 30 pre-existing failures. Skip
  guards for optional dependencies, mock fixes, routing assertion updates.
- **Security hardening** (#111, #113) — prevent stack trace exposure in
  file API responses, clear-text logging of sensitive reference data.
- **Surplus Telegram delivery** (#105) — surplus-originated reflections
  now reach Telegram instead of silently completing.
- **Approval system** (#101) — micro-reflection salience gate removed
  (user sees everything), approval_request_id now populated on
  cli_approved.
- **Stale update banner** (#103) — dashboard auto-resolves the
  update-available banner after successful update.
- **Process reaper** (#10aa9edc) — extended to kill stale Claude sessions
  older than 7 days.

---

## [v3.0a7] - 2026-04-19

25-commit release. Themes: **dashboard and settings overhaul**, **web
fetching upgrade**, **timezone correctness**, and **operational
documentation**.

### Added

- **Scrapling TLS fingerprinting** (#75) — web fetcher upgraded with
  anti-bot bypass via `curl_cffi` TLS impersonation. Cloudflare Quick
  Actions (`/markdown`, `/json`) for JS-rendered content extraction.
- **Observation surfacing + output verification** (#77) — autonomous
  task executor now verifies its own output against success criteria.
  Observations surface in dashboard and outreach.
- **Surplus config wiring + DB-backed approvals** (#84) — surplus
  compute settings configurable via dashboard. Sentinel approvals
  persisted to database (survive restarts).
- **MCP module config overlay** (#94) — MCP tools now discover modules
  from both repo and local config directories, matching runtime behavior.
- **Contribution sanitizer** — auto-blocks gitignored paths from upstream
  PRs.

### Changed

- **Identity file deduplication** (#93) — consolidated overlapping
  content across CLAUDE.md, SOUL.md, STEERING.md, and CONVERSATION.md.
  Each file now has a distinct scope with no redundancy.
- **Settings panel functional** (#82, #89) — settings viewer, routing
  panel consolidation, environment variable expansion fix. Previously
  read-only, now editable.
- **Approval queue** — moved from dedicated page to dashboard overview
  with inline resume mechanism.
- **Knowledge and Memory UI** (#86) — resizable file browser, improved
  layout, tmux compatibility fix.
- **Process management docs** — CLAUDE.md documents systemd units, MCP
  server lifecycle, and the nohup prohibition.

### Fixed

- **Timezone across the board** (#79) — outreach scheduling, alert
  timestamps, and follow-up due dates now respect the configured user
  timezone instead of defaulting to UTC.
- **Neural monitor accuracy** (#92) — disabled providers excluded from
  health display and dropdown. Accuracy metrics cleaned up.
- **Anthropic provider regression** (#88) — providers restored after
  routing config change accidentally dropped them. False queue-empty
  alerts eliminated.
- **SSH PATH** (#87) — Claude CLI now found in SSH RemoteCommand context
  (Guardian diagnosis sessions).
- **Knowledge tab** (#82, #83) — stats endpoint AttributeError fixed,
  CSS corrected, tab fully functional.
- **Strategic reflection routing** (#81) — reflection sessions now route
  to correct providers. Essential knowledge noise reduced.
- **Morning report** (#85) — formatting, missing data handling, and
  observation inclusion fixes.
- **Extraction quality** (#76) — dashboard thresholds tuned, code index
  priority corrected.

---

## [v3.0a6] - 2026-04-17

137-commit release. Major themes: **knowledge ingestion pipeline**,
**embedding storm fix** (Ollama CPU spikes eliminated), **awareness
scoring overhaul**, and **persistent reference store**.

### Added

- **Knowledge ingestion pipeline** (#67, #68) — `knowledge_ingest` MCP
  tool for ingesting files and URLs as authoritative knowledge units.
  Dashboard file upload UX with drag-drop support and ingestion worker.
- **Awareness scoring overhaul** (#65) — signal redistribution across
  subsystems, subsystem-level signals, citation tracking for score
  attribution.
- **Persistent reference store** (#58) — unified store for credentials,
  URLs, IPs, and account handles learned across sessions. Auto-capture
  from conversations, `reference_lookup` retrieval, read-only mirror at
  `~/.genesis/known-to-genesis.md`.
- **Merge/push safety hooks** (#60) — PreToolUse hooks block `git merge`
  on main and `git push origin main` to enforce PR workflow.
- **Session observer** — real-time tool activity capture for foreground
  CC sessions, feeding memory extraction.
- **Codebase navigation MCP tool** — progressive drill-down code
  exploration (`codebase_navigate`).

### Changed

- **Queue-first extraction** (#66) — memory extraction no longer
  hammers the embedding backend with hundreds of sequential calls.
  Stores FTS5-only, queues embeddings for the recovery worker's paced
  drain (10/min). Reduces Ollama embed calls from ~562/hr to ~10/min.
- **Ollama health cache** (#66) — `is_available()` results cached for
  120s, eliminating ~818 uncached `/api/tags` polls per hour.
- **Budget event emission** (#71) — `budget.exceeded` events fire once
  per budget period (daily/weekly/monthly) instead of on every routing
  call. Reduces log entries from ~2,857/7hr to 1 per period crossing.
- **Embedding recovery drain limit** — increased 100 → 500 to handle
  full extraction cycle output in a single recovery pass.
- **CLAUDE.md scope split** — extracted Serena guide, moved dev rules
  to genesis-development skill, compressed main CLAUDE.md.

### Fixed

- **Systemd PATH** (#66) — service templates now include Claude CLI bin
  dir (`__CC_BIN_DIR__`), fixing "Claude CLI not found" errors in
  Telegram bridge sessions. Detected at install time, falls back to
  `~/.npm-global/bin`.
- **Embedding recovery status** (#66) — recovery worker now updates
  `memory_metadata.embedding_status` from "pending" to "embedded"
  after successful recovery (was stale on the queue-first path).
- **Security**: redact identifier in migration dry-run log (#70).
- **Cognitive state catch-22** (#64) — dashboard quality issues and
  circular dependency in state initialization.
- **Backup passphrase, cost attribution, dashboard UX** (#63) — four
  fixes from post-Codex audit.
- **OpenCode wrapper** (#61) — silent exit when no stale sessions exist.

---

## [v3.0a5] - 2026-04-17

120-commit batch release — memory v4, surplus compute, eval framework,
follow-ups, new providers, and update-system improvements.

### Added

- **4-layer memory redesign** (#37) — hybrid retrieval (vector + FTS5 +
  RRF fusion), wing/room taxonomy, essential knowledge layer, activation
  scoring, graph traversal.
- **Skill validator + evolution pipeline** (#34) — validation framework
  for skills with evolution tracking.
- **Encrypted backups** (#53) — Qdrant snapshot encryption, backup
  history migration script.
- **"Your Genesis"** (#48) — encrypted backups, `restore.sh`, unified
  docs for the dual-repo model.
- **Outreach recovery worker** — retries failed deliveries with backoff.
- **Approval staleness + session timezone** — stale approvals
  auto-expire, timezone-aware session tracking.
- **Dashboard timezone endpoint** — configurable timezone via settings.

### Fixed (install hardening, PRs #46-52)

13 install fixes from fresh-VM testing:
- Auto-scale container resources to host capacity (#46).
- Five bugs from fresh VM install test (#47).
- Single incus exec smoke test + timezone seed (#50).
- Unbound `UBUNTU_UID` in timezone seed (#51).
- Remove `secrets.env` seed that broke `git clone` (#52).
- TTY detection, timezone persistence across `apt-get`, `read` EOF.

### Fixed (other)

- **Security**: CodeQL findings — stack-trace exposure, workflow
  permissions (#39).
- **Reflection**: post-Codex audit Phase 1+2 — stop silent failures,
  influence timing, surplus count, scheduler timezone, `parse_failed`.
- **Routing/Sentinel**: `cb.is_available()` fix + `watchdog_failing`
  Tier 2.
- **Guardian**: SSH test uses gateway-compatible ping; `cp -rT` for
  update path.
- **Telegram**: offset persist suppressed on fresh processes (#43).
- **Dashboard**: portability — genericize tz examples (#45).
- **Outreach**: remove dead dedup code.
- **CI**: detect-secrets false positive allowlist (#41).
- README updated — Genesis in 30 seconds, quickstart first, 100k+ LOC.
- Stale branch auto-cleanup after public releases (#44).

---

## [v3.0a4] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- **Merge-based update system** — Genesis updates via `git merge` instead
  of rebase, compatible with the dual-repo model. Three-tier CC
  escalation for conflict resolution: Haiku (watch), Sonnet (resolve
  trivial), Opus (deep incompatibilities). Crash recovery via
  `update_state.json` phase tracking with automatic rollback.
- Tag-based version comparison (robust against squash-merge divergence).
- Dashboard poll timeout extended to 10 minutes.
- Service management without systemd D-Bus session bus (reads PID from
  lock file).

### Fixed

- PID file cleanup moved to Python `finally` blocks.
- `proc.wait(timeout=3600)` prevents hung CC session wedging background
  thread.
- Escalation recovery in `update_progress()` auto-spawns Tier 2 after
  Flask restart.
- JSON heredoc injection fixed (`FAILEOF`/`CEOF` replaced with
  `json.dumps` via env vars).
- Removed nohup fallback from service management; systemd only.
- `_orchestrator_alive` set inside lock before `thread.start()` (TOCTOU).

---

## [v3.0a3-hf3] - 2026-04-12

Public-primary repo overhaul — Genesis now defaults to install-agnostic
configuration. Machine-specific values (IPs, timezone, GitHub identity)
move to `~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml` instead of being hardcoded in
the repo. Sets up the public repo (`GENesis-AGI`) as the primary
development target going forward.

### Added

- **Local config overlay** (`~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml`). Three-tier
  precedence: env var > local config > safe default. Covers Ollama/LM
  Studio URLs, timezone, GitHub identity. Generate with
  `./scripts/setup-local-config.sh`.
- **`setup-local-config.sh`** — Interactive setup script for new installs.
  Auto-detects system timezone, migrates `career-agent.yaml` to local
  overlay on first run.
- **Local module overlay** (`~/.genesis/config/modules/`). User-specific
  module configs (e.g. career-agent) live outside the repo; local files
  take precedence over repo files on same filename.
- **Local research-profile overlay** (`~/.genesis/config/research-profiles/`).
  `ProfileLoader.merge_overlay()` loads user-specific profiles not
  committed to the repo.
- **CI leak detector** — `leak-detector` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  blocks PRs with hardcoded timezones, personal paths, private repo refs,
  secrets (`detect-secrets`), and personal email addresses.
- **`config/genesis.yaml.example`** — Template for local config.

### Changed

- Config YAMLs (`ego`, `outreach`, `inbox_monitor`, `mail_monitor`):
  timezone defaults changed from `America/New_York` to `UTC`. Existing
  installs set timezone in `~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml`.
- `tz.py`, dataclass defaults, and config loaders now resolve timezone
  via `user_timezone()` from `env.py` instead of hardcoded string.
- CLAUDE.md: hardcoded IPs and GitHub usernames removed; network config
  points to local config file.
- `.claude/docs/dual-repo.md` rewritten for three-repo model.

### Fixed

- `prepare-public-release.sh` portability scan now excludes `ci.yml`
  (the leak-detector job contains timezone patterns as scanner definitions,
  not config leaks). Removed stale `Build Order` CLAUDE.md regex.

---

## [v3.0a3-hf1] - 2026-04-11

Hotfix immediately after v3.0a3 to restore Phase 6 functionality in the
public release and clear a caplog-flakiness regression. Also rides along
a small community security fix.

### Fixed

- **Release-pipeline templating was too broad.** `prepare-public-release.sh`'s
  step 5b passes (`find + grep + sed -i`) rewrote the contribution
  sanitizer's own regex patterns, the `tz.py` default timezone, and a
  couple of test fixtures that legitimately hold these literals as data.
  In the v3.0a3 public release this shipped a broken Phase 6 sanitizer —
  patterns like `${HOME}/genesis` didn't parse as intended, `\bUTC\b` was
  flagging the opposite of user-specific timezones, and the `tz.py` default
  `_DEFAULT_TZ` was clobbered. Added inline `-not -path` exclusions to
  every 5b templating pass for `src/genesis/contribution/sanitize.py`,
  `tests/test_contribution/test_sanitize.py`, `src/genesis/util/tz.py`,
  `tests/test_util/test_tz.py`, `tests/test_autonomy/test_protection.py`,
  `tests/test_hooks/test_inline_hooks.py`, and `tests/conftest.py`.
  Restores Phase 6 sanitizer correctness and clears 11 public CI failures.
- **Flaky `caplog` assertion in `test_dispatch_unknown_falls_back_to_dual`.**
  Commit `0ad9567` had previously removed the exact same assertion
  because caplog's logger-name filter interacts with other tests' logger
  configuration under the full suite; commit `3bbae15` re-introduced it
  in the F1 dispatch routing wiring. Dropped the log-message sniff again;
  kept the behavioural fallback assertion.
- **Telegram adapter refuses to start with empty / invalid
  `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS`.** Cherry-picked from community PR
  `WingedGuardian/GENesis-AGI#29`. Previously the bot would start silently
  and allow messages from **all** users when `allowed_users` was empty or
  contained only invalid UIDs (e.g. someone pasting a bot token into the
  wrong field). Dashboard `PUT /api/genesis/secrets` now rejects values
  containing `:` (looks like a bot token) or non-numeric IDs with a clear
  error pointing to `@userinfobot`. `secrets.env.example` documents the
  expected format for each Telegram field.

### Known Issues (tracked as follow-ups, not blocking this hotfix)

- `tests/test_runtime/test_runtime_retriever.py::test_retriever_created_after_bootstrap`
  fails only in GH Actions CI (passes locally on 2026-04-11) — suspected
  test isolation / mock state pollution under the full suite. Filed as a
  follow-up investigation; does not affect runtime behaviour.
- `tests/test_qdrant/test_collections.py` has no `skipif` fixture and
  errors (not fails) when Qdrant isn't running on `localhost:6333`.
  Separate hotfix will add a module-level fixture that pings the port and
  skips the suite with a clear message on `ConnectionError`.

---

## [v3.0a3] - 2026-04-11

Large release. Major new features: **community contribution pipeline**
(Phase 6), **Sentinel** container-side guardian, **self-update infrastructure**,
and a top-to-bottom overhaul of the install experience, Guardian recovery,
approval UX, and the neural monitor dashboard. Also clears a long tail of
runtime, routing, and observability issues accumulated since v3.0a2-hf5.

### Added

**Community contribution pipeline (Phase 6)**

- **`genesis contribute <sha>` CLI** — one-shot pipeline that converts a
  `fix:` commit into a draft PR against the public Genesis repo. Flow:
  divergence check → version gate → sanitizer → adversarial review →
  consent prompt → draft PR via `gh`. Pseudonymous by default
  (`contributor-<id>@genesis.local`); `--identify` uses the user's real
  git identity. MVP scope: bug fixes only (`--allow-non-fix` to override).
- **Post-commit offer hook** — committing a `fix:` commit drops a marker
  in `~/.genesis/pending-offers/`; the `contribution_offer_hook.py`
  UserPromptSubmit hook injects a `[Contribution]` system-reminder on
  the next prompt so Genesis can proactively offer to upstream the fix.
  `fix(local):` scope opts out of the offer entirely.
- **Fail-closed sanitizer** — refuses any diff containing secrets, personal
  email addresses, hardcoded IPs, `/home/ubuntu` paths, or files on the
  `contribution_forbidden` tier of `config/protected_paths.yaml`. Runs
  `detect-secrets`, portability, and path-tier scanners.
- **Adversarial review chain** — Codex CLI first, Claude Code subagent
  fallback, Genesis-native reviewer last. First-success wins; result is
  embedded in the PR body.
- **PR body metadata** — every generated PR includes contributor install
  version (`<version>@<short-sha>`), version drift status, pseudonymous
  install ID, sanitizer finding count + scanners run, and review result.
- **Branch-push flow** — contributions land on a fresh branch named by
  commit sha, pushed to the contributor's fork. E2E CLI test covers the
  full hook → sanitizer → review → branch-push path.

**Sentinel (container-side guardian)**

- **New package `src/genesis/sentinel/`** — container-side complement to
  the host-side Guardian. Runs inside the container, monitors Genesis
  infrastructure with the fire alarm taxonomy (WARN / DEGRADED / DOWN),
  and triggers dormant remediations via the registry.
- **Trigger sources + infrastructure monitor** — wires Qdrant, database,
  memory, and process health into the Sentinel trigger pipeline.
- **Runtime wiring + capability registration** — Sentinel registers as a
  first-class capability, surfaces state in the dashboard Services card,
  and its awareness is folded into Guardian briefings + diagnosis.
- **V4 architecture §8.1/8.2 updated** with implementation status.

**Self-update infrastructure**

- **`GenesisVersionCollector`** — awareness-loop collector checks for
  upstream updates every 6h (configurable), stores observations, sends
  Telegram alerts, surfaces "update available" in the dashboard health
  panel, and detects update failures.
- **Update settings domain** — new `config/updates.yaml` with check
  interval, notification channel, and auto-apply policy (opt-in only).
  Configurable via `settings_update("updates", ...)` MCP tool.
- **Schema migration framework** — `src/genesis/db/migrations/` with
  `MigrationRunner`, CLI (`python -m genesis.db.migrations`), and
  versioned migration files. Tracking table `schema_migrations` records
  applied migrations. First migration: `update_history` table.
- **Public release CI/CD** — `.github/workflows/public-release.yaml`
  triggered on version tags. Runs `prepare-public-release.sh`, secret
  scan, portability scan, and uploads sanitized artifact for maintainer
  review.
- **`detect-secrets` dependency** — added to `[release]` optional deps in
  `pyproject.toml`, unblocking the secret scan step that was previously
  silently skipping.

**Install & host setup**

- **13 resilience fixes from failure-mode audit** — hardens `install.sh`,
  `bootstrap.sh`, and `update.sh` against partial failures, rerun damage,
  missing preconditions, and silently-skipped steps.
- **Container smoke test + damage detection on re-run** — re-running the
  installer now detects a damaged previous run and either repairs or
  fails loudly instead of silently producing a broken state.
- **Tailscale in host setup** — `host-setup.sh` installs Tailscale and
  prompts for authentication during setup (supports `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY`
  for unattended installs).
- **Node.js + Claude Code on host VM** — `host-setup.sh` installs Node.js
  20.x and Claude Code on the host (not just the container), enabling
  Guardian CC diagnosis sessions.
- **Node.js ≥ 20** required (was 18); Guardian state reset on container
  recreate.

**Approval UX & autonomy**

- **Approval UX redesign** — dedicated Telegram topic, inline buttons,
  call-site gating so approvals are attributed to the caller, not the
  model. Batch CLI approval flow.
- **Autonomous CLI approval gate wired into standalone server** — gate +
  `approvals` topic registered during standalone startup (previously
  only wired in the AZ hosting mode, silently disabled standalone).
- **Inbox approval-pending resume flow** — stable approval key + resume
  path so restarts don't orphan in-flight approvals.

**Dashboard & observability**

- **Neural monitor visual overhaul** — glowing dots, cleaner layout,
  proportional radial placement, constellation map layout option,
  provider chain fixes. Dispatch mode toggle wired to runtime routing
  with save-verify feedback.
- **Sentinel state in Services card.**
- **Config tab UX overhaul** — visibility, dropdowns, tooltips, health
  indicators. Secret values gated behind auth.
- **Dropped-tick events surfaced** from the awareness loop.
- **Container memory decomposition** into anon/file/kernel components.
- **`runtime.peek()`** — read-only runtime snapshot used by observability
  callers that previously forced full runtime access.

**Docs & conventions**

- **No-silent-timeouts rule** added to `CLAUDE.md` — new timeouts on
  reflections, CC calls, and long-thinking paths require explicit user
  approval with evidence of a real failure mode.
- **Never ignore a bug** rule — bugs encountered in any work must be
  fixed inline or tracked as follow-ups; "out of scope" is not an option.
- **V4 ego / infra self-monitor design** + incident report.

### Changed

- **`update.sh` overhaul** — pre-update backup via `backup.sh`, rollback
  tags (`pre-update-{timestamp}`), idempotent `bootstrap.sh` post-pull
  (replaces manual pip install), health verification with 3× retry,
  automatic rollback on failure, CC-assisted recovery context file
  (`~/.genesis/last_update_failure.json`).
- **Mistral routing rationalization** — consolidated Mistral providers
  and call sites, raised `mistral-large-free` rpm 2 → 4 and
  `mistral-small-free` rpm 2 → 30 based on observed usage (previous
  limits were ~5× over-conservative).
- **Routing tail fallback** added for sites 29 and 35, stopping the
  sentinel DOWN alarm from chain exhaustion.
- **Proactive DLQ orphan scan** on routing config reload — expires DLQ
  items whose `call_site_id` no longer exists instead of leaving them
  stranded.
- **Misinterpreted memory-backlog signal removed end-to-end** from the
  awareness loop (was firing on normal state).
- **Watchdog staleness threshold** 300s → 900s to stop false positives
  during legitimate long-running ticks.
- **`runtime/_core.py` split** under the 600 LOC soft target — converted
  to `runtime/` package with 20 init modules. Extracted mixins:
  `_properties.py`, `_pause_state.py`, `_init_delegates.py`,
  `_degradation.py`, `_capabilities.py`, `_job_health.py`. Re-exported
  from `__init__.py` for backward compatibility.
- **`ashutdown`** async shutdown path + `job_health` envelope for MCP
  health surfaces.
- **`8_memory_consolidation`** call site renamed to `8_ego_compaction`
  for clarity.
- **Ego sessions** remain inert until beta — built but not registered
  in bootstrap.

### Fixed

- **Guardian recovery hardening** — auth middleware was blocking
  Guardian's own health probes, contributing to the 2026-04-08 memory
  exhaustion incident. Auth now gates browser pages only; `/api/` and
  `/v1/` routes are exempt. See `docs/incidents/2026-04-08-memory-exhaustion.md`.
- **Broken page cache reclaim** — watchdog/Guardian collector service
  name fix plus explicit reclaim trigger; container no longer drifts
  toward OOM under sustained read load.
- **Guardian heartbeat decoupled from HEALTHY state** — previously,
  Guardian only emitted heartbeats while reporting HEALTHY, so DEGRADED
  or DOWN states silently stopped the heartbeat stream.
- **Guardian ICMP probe** retries once to absorb bridge ARP races that
  were producing spurious DOWN readings on container recreate.
- **Runtime status writer decoupled from awareness tick** — a slow tick
  no longer blocks status writes, and a slow status write no longer
  delays the next tick.
- **`surplus.py` zombie runtime singleton** — the surplus worker was
  spawning a parallel Genesis runtime in-process when the primary
  runtime's observability snapshot asked for state. Fixed by routing
  through `runtime.peek()`.
- **Circular import crashing `genesis-memory` MCP** — resolved, with
  loud failure reporting instead of the previous silent-skip behavior.
- **Browser tools converted from Playwright sync → async API** —
  sync-in-async-context was deadlocking the MCP server.
- **`TopicManager` wired into standalone startup path** (was only
  wired in AZ mode, silently missing in standalone).
- **IPC non-dict response wrapping** — `module_call` no longer returns
  a bare list when a module returns one; wrapped consistently so
  callers don't need to handle both shapes.
- **Inbox routing** — removed free-SLM routing path, kept approval gate,
  fixed empty-content bug that was dropping messages.
- **Autonomous DM silent fallback surfaced** — fallback path used to
  silently succeed with no user visibility; now surfaces the fallback
  and doesn't stall reask on fail.
- **`update.sh` rollback correctness** — rollback used `git checkout <tag>`
  which left the repo in detached HEAD. Now `git checkout main &&
  git reset --hard <tag>` preserves the branch. Silent failure paths
  (`|| true`) removed, ERR trap covers all mutating steps, health
  endpoint + migration failures now trigger rollback. Added worktree
  guard (refuses to run from `.claude/worktrees/`). `update_history`
  rows written on both success and failure.
- **Migration runner atomicity** — body + tracking row were committed
  separately (risk of "applied but unrecorded"), and Python sqlite3
  auto-commits before DDL when using `db.commit()`/`db.rollback()`.
  Fixed with explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` SQL
  including DDL in the transaction. Regression test added.
- **Public release CI secret scan** — `detect-secrets` failures were
  silenced by `|| true`, bare `except: print(0)`, and `2>/dev/null`,
  converting scanner crashes into "0 findings" (false PASS). Now fails
  loudly.
- **`GenesisVersionCollector`** — `_check_upstream` silently returned
  `(0, "")` on git fetch failure. Now raises with stderr context.
  Local update resolves prior `genesis_update_available` observations
  so dashboard alert clears immediately. Failure file archived to
  `.processed.json` after processing instead of being re-read every
  awareness tick.
- **Updates settings validator** — non-dict sections silently passed;
  `auto_apply.allowed_impacts` accepted `action_needed` and `breaking`
  despite config comment saying those always require manual approval.
  Both now rejected.
- **Observability** — `errors.py` data-returning paths now log at ERROR
  with `exc_info=True` (dead letter query, circuit breaker check, event
  log query, genesis update alert query). One wrong log message fixed.
- **Health MCP** — hermetic cleanup rounds 2 + 3, transport smoke
  canary expanded to full read-only matrix, heartbeat query error
  raised DEBUG → ERROR, narrow error handling, tighter bootstrap
  manifest messages, worktree test isolation fix in `conftest.py`.
- **Test suite** — cleared 26 pre-existing test failures; root-caused
  test pollution; added 31 new tests for version collector, migration
  runner atomicity, and settings validator edge cases.
- **`SMOKE_FAIL` unbound var** in install scripts.
- **Integer pixel margins** for neural monitor periphery dots (were
  rendering blurry on fractional values).

### Known Limitations

- **Phase 6 MVP is bug-fixes-only.** Feature contributions are blocked
  by the version gate unless `--allow-non-fix` is passed explicitly.
- **Ego sessions remain inert.** Built but not registered in bootstrap;
  will be wired when the autonomous proposal pipeline is ready for
  live use.

## [v3.0a2-hf5] - 2026-04-07

### Added

- **Tailscale in host setup** — `host-setup.sh` now installs Tailscale and
  prompts for authentication during setup. Headless server users get an
  immediately usable dashboard URL on their tailnet without SSH tunneling.
  Supports `TAILSCALE_AUTH_KEY` env var for CI/unattended installs.
- **Node.js + Claude Code on host VM** — `host-setup.sh` now installs
  Node.js 20.x and Claude Code on the host VM (not just inside the
  container), enabling Guardian CC diagnosis sessions and direct host
  interaction from day one.

### Changed

- **Guardian framing** — Guardian is no longer framed as optional. Install
  failures now show a prominent box identifying Guardian as a core subsystem
  (health monitoring, diagnosis, recovery) that must be fixed. Final setup
  report reworded: Guardian is "always running"; Claude Code auth enables
  agentic diagnosis as an add-on, not as the thing that "enables" Guardian.

---

## [3.0a2-hf4]

### Fixed

- **GCP split-disk install** — on cloud VMs where `/home` is a separate
  larger disk than `/`, Incus now stores container data under
  `/home/incus-data` instead of the root partition. Disk check validates
  the actual Incus storage location and requires 15GB free.
- **Guardian pip bootstrap** — Debian creates venvs without pip even when
  `ensurepip` imports successfully (module is present but non-functional).
  Guardian now detects missing pip post-venv and bootstraps via
  `ensurepip --upgrade` or `get-pip.py`.

---

## [3.0a2-hf3]

### Added

- **Provider Keys panel** — write-only secrets management in Settings tab.
  Shows configured/not_set status for all 39 API keys across 7 groups parsed
  from `secrets.env.example`. Values are never returned by the API. Atomic
  file writes (tempfile + os.replace), chmod 600, immediate env reload.
- **Config tab UX** — human-readable labels, tooltips, dropdowns for enum
  settings (provider, model, effort, channels), proper domain name display.
  Replaced all underscore identifiers and free-text fields that need exact values.

### Fixed

- **Install portability** — `install_guardian.sh` now auto-detects host Python
  version and installs the matching `python3.X-venv` package if missing.
  Supports Debian 12 (Python 3.11) — Guardian only needs pyyaml, no 3.12
  requirement on the host VM.
- **Container venv** — `host-setup.sh` tries `python3.12-venv` first, falls
  back to `python3-venv` for distros that don't package them separately.
- **Network identity in CLAUDE.md** — `update.sh` now detects and rewrites
  unresolved template variables (`${CONTAINER_IP:-localhost}` etc.) with
  real IPs from the running container and guardian_remote.yaml.
- **Pre-commit hook** — `secrets.env.example` was blocked by the secrets
  file filter (regex matched `secrets\.env` before the `.example` suffix).
  Now explicitly allows `.example` files through.

---

## [3.0a2-hf2]

### Added

- **Dashboard authentication** — optional password-based access control for the
  dashboard. Set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` in secrets.env to enable. Cookie-based
  30-day sessions, rate-limited login (5 attempts/5-min lockout), logout button.
  When no password is set, dashboard works as before (backward compatible).
- **Install UX overhaul** — welcome/recovery banners, contextual CC login
  prompts (explains Genesis vs Guardian purpose), `genesis` shell alias for
  convenient container access from host
- **Dashboard accessibility** — Incus proxy device forwarding host:5000 →
  container:5000, network topology detection (IPv4/IPv6/Tailscale), SSH
  tunnel and Tailscale guidance in post-install report
- **Network identity** — container and host IPs (v4 + v6) persisted in
  CLAUDE.md for both Genesis and Guardian; guardian-gateway appends network
  section on code updates
- **Guardian onboarding** — interactive CC login prompt during install,
  network section in Guardian CLAUDE.md
- **Uninstall script** — `scripts/uninstall.sh` for clean removal

### Fixed

- **Services not starting after install** — `genesis-server` was enabled but
  never started; service gate blocked enable/start on re-runs. Now
  unconditionally enables and starts both services
- **Dashboard unreachable from browser** — container IP not routable from
  external network; proxy device now forwards host port
- **`/setup` not found on new installs** — CC discovers slash commands from
  project root; users landing in `~` couldn't find `.claude/commands/`.
  Auto-cd to `~/genesis` on login fixes this
- **Install final output** — removed stale "start services manually" step
  (services auto-start now), shows actual service status, simplified guidance
- **Guardian stuck in CONFIRMED_DEAD** — state machine never checked if
  signals recovered; container could be perfectly healthy while Guardian
  reported it as dead indefinitely. Now auto-recovers when all signals
  return to healthy
- **Neural monitor false green for unconfigured providers** — health probe
  hit unauthenticated `/models` endpoint for providers with `base_url` but
  no API key (e.g., GLM5/Zenmux), getting HTTP 200 and reporting "reachable"
- **CC auto-updater nag** — disabled for pinned versions via
  `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` in project settings

---

## [3.0a2-hf1]

### Added

- **User model enrichment** — three-tier user model (identity, preferences,
  knowledge) with unified knowledge pipeline feeding reflection and conversation
- **CI workflow** — ruff lint + pytest with advisory test gate

### Fixed

- **Terminal**: WebSocket compatibility with simple_websocket >=1.0 (returns
  None on timeout instead of raising TimeoutError)
- **CC invoker**: Handle missing claude CLI gracefully (FileNotFoundError)
- **Dependencies**: Pin wsproto>=1.2 (flask-sock transitive dep)
- **Dashboard**: Stale CC status display, degradation calculation, circuit
  breaker backoff timing
- **CI**: Scope lint to src/tests/scripts, ignore preserved AZ-era test files,
  make test job non-blocking while stabilizing
- **Lint**: Resolve all ruff errors (unused vars, unsorted imports, SIM105)

---

## [3.0a2]

### Changed

- **Standalone-only architecture** — Agent Zero fully removed. Genesis runs as
  a standalone server (`python -m genesis serve`) with its own dashboard,
  terminal, and API. AZ can still be used as an optional external agent
  framework via the adapter interface, but is no longer required or bundled.
- **OpenClaw gateway** — Genesis exposes `POST /v1/chat/completions` so OpenClaw
  (or any OpenAI-compatible router) can route channels through it
- **SDK-primary engine routing** — Claude SDK API is the primary execution path;
  Claude Code subprocess is optional based on operator preference

### Added

- **Neural monitor overhaul** — provider probes, subsystem grouping, circuit
  breaker wiring, detail panel with live backend data, warning severity color,
  subsystem sector clustering, visual redesign (larger diagram, refined colors),
  call site triage with naming consistency
- **Settings UX** — human-readable labels, tooltips, channel dropdown
- **Chain editor** — CC entries editable, repositionable, and removable
- **Autonomy enforcement** — data-driven RuleEngine with graduated enforcement
  spectrum (inform → guide → guard → block), SteerMessage abstraction
- **Anti-vision identity boundaries** — selective MCP loading, executor plan
  directive for content evaluation
- **User-evaluate skill** — evaluate content through Genesis's user model
- **update.sh** — pull, sync dependencies, restart services in one command

### Fixed

- **host-setup.sh**: Fix container networking on cloud VMs (GCP, AWS, Azure) —
  UFW `deny (routed)` default policy was blocking all forwarded container traffic
  (DNS, HTTPS). Script now adds `ufw route allow` rules for the Incus bridge.
  Also adds nftables accept rules as defense-in-depth for non-UFW distros.
- **host-setup.sh**: Auto-activate `incus-admin` group after Incus install —
  script previously exited with a permission error, requiring manual
  `newgrp incus-admin` to recover
- **host-setup.sh**: Fail fast on prerequisite install or git clone errors
  instead of continuing to "Genesis is ready" with a broken container
- **host-setup.sh**: Add ERR trap with line number, command, and exit code on
  any failure; `DEBUG=1` enables full `set -x` tracing
- **host-setup.sh**: Enable IP forwarding and bridge NAT before container
  creation; show progress during package installation
- **Dashboard**: uptime counter timezone bug, restart button self-restart,
  post-AZ-removal regressions, probe override guard, detail panel staleness,
  degraded status color visibility
- **Routing**: CC-only model saves silently dropped + input validation missing
- **update.sh**: Use `--rebase` to avoid divergent-branch errors on pull
- **Terminal**: Prefill CC command without auto-executing (user chooses when)
- **push-public-release.sh**: Create tag and GitHub Release even when content
  was already pushed (previously exited early, skipping the release step)
- **install.sh**: Add `cd ~/genesis &&` to headless login instructions so
  first-time users run `claude login` from the correct directory

---

## [v3.0a] - 2026-04-03

Genesis v3 — complete autonomous agent system. First public release.
All Phase 0–9 subsystems built, wired, and tested.

### Added

- **Memory system** — hybrid Qdrant vector + SQLite FTS5 search, episodic memory
  with session provenance, proactive memory injection at session start
- **Telegram integration** — resilient polling adapter with text, voice, photo,
  and document support; supergroup/forum topic routing; streaming responses
  via edit-based drafts; voice transcription via Whisper
- **Morning reports** — daily system state digest via Telegram with configurable
  structure and LLM-generated synthesis
- **Guardian** — host-VM watchdog with agentic Claude Opus diagnosis, briefing
  bridge, credential bridge, and shared filesystem mount
- **MCP servers** — memory recall, outreach queue, health status, and recon
  tools exposed as MCP endpoints for foreground Claude Code sessions
- **Outreach pipeline** — category-based message routing (alerts, digests,
  surplus, recon), engagement tracking, morning report scheduler
- **Reflection system** — background micro/light/deep/strategic reflection
  sessions with consolidation into episodic memory
- **Dual-repo distribution** — private working repo + public GENesis-AGI release
  with automated stripping of user-specific content
- **Dashboard** — web UI with system health, session management, built-in
  terminal, settings hub
- **Standalone server** — `python -m genesis serve` runs dashboard, API, and
  all subsystems; adapter protocol for provider-agnostic operation
- **Model routing** — configurable per-call-site routing with fallback chains,
  cost tracking, and provider health monitoring
- **Inbox monitor** — filesystem inbox for asynchronous task ingestion
- **Knowledge graph** — observation/finding/pattern storage with deduplication
- **Ego session framework** — autonomous proposal pipeline (inert until beta)
- **Hooks system** — PreToolUse/PostToolUse guards for behavioral enforcement
  (blocking pip editable installs to worktrees, validating kill signals, etc.)
- **Bootstrap script** — idempotent machine setup: venv, secrets, systemd
  services, Claude Code config generation

### Breaking

- Requires Python 3.12 and Ubuntu 22.04+
- `secrets.env` must be populated with API keys before first run
- Telegram bot token required for channel features
- Qdrant must be running locally (`localhost:6333`)
