"""AccountActivityMonitor — deterministic (no-LLM) watch for EXTERNAL GitHub
activity on the owner's repos.

Runs every ~2h from the surplus scheduler. It answers one question with `gh`
calls and no LLM: did a real, external human (not the owner, not a bot/org) act
on one of the owner's flagship repos — open a PR/issue, comment, post a
discussion, or reply on one? Genuine external activity is recorded as a
``github_account_activity`` observation (the 6h digest campaign consumes these);
a FIRST-TIME external contributor additionally pushes an immediate Telegram ping.

Design notes:
- **SIBLING to ``ReconGatherer``**, not a method on it — that class has a
  load-bearing no-push contract. This class pushes (like ``cc_update_analyzer``).
- **Pipeline is lazy-resolved at tick time** (``GenesisRuntime.instance()``):
  surplus init runs BEFORE outreach init, so the pipeline does not exist when
  this monitor is constructed. Its first tick is hours after boot.
- **run_gh_checked** (not ``run_gh``) so a failed poll is distinguishable from an
  empty one — a rate-limited poll must NOT advance the cursor (or a contributor
  who acted during the failed window is lost forever).
- **created_at, not updated_at.** GitHub's ``?since=`` filters on *updated_at*, so
  an old issue that is merely edited/closed/labeled re-surfaces and would be
  mis-recorded as new activity by its ORIGINAL author. We key everything on the
  immutable ``created_at`` and filter ``cursor < created_at <= watermark`` — so
  only genuine new contributions count, each with the correct actor.
- **Watermark cursor.** ``wm`` is captured BEFORE polling; the cursor advances to
  ``wm`` (not the newest event's ts), so an event created mid-poll — after one
  feed's request but before another's — is never skipped (it re-fetches next
  tick; ``since`` is exclusive and event-dedup makes the overlap a no-op).
- **State:** per-repo cursor in a home-anchored JSON sidecar (mutable,
  must-never-expire — the ``pr_watch`` precedent); event-dedup + first-contact via
  the observation-hash primitive (no new table). A non-delivered first-time ping
  is held in a ``github_ping_pending`` marker and retried each tick until it
  lands, so a failed delivery never silently burns the first-contact signal.
- **Modes** (``github_steward_config``): ``off`` / ``observe`` (record, never
  ping — first-deploy default, seeds the seen-actor set) / ``live`` (ping).

        substring test pick the wrong branch, request an endpoint that does not
        exist, and mark the whole read incomplete. The type field is what GitHub

        A pull request carries THREE disjoint text surfaces — inline review

        ``/commits/{sha}/comments``. Discussions are GraphQL-only and are handled
        by the caller before reaching here.

# Timeline events we UNDERSTAND and which carry no attributable identity. A
# `committed` row is a push: MEASURED live it has no `.actor`, no `.created_at`,
# and an `author` of {name, email, date} carrying no login. Knowing a shape has
# no identity is NOT the same as never having seen it, and conflating the two is
# what made the drop unreachable — every one of this install's 9 sampled pull
# requests carries 2-16 `committed` rows, so treating them as unknown made every
# pull request permanently uncertain.
#
# COST, stated because it is real: an external contributor whose ONLY action in a
# window is pushing commits is not attributable from this surface, and that
# window reads as empty. A force-push emits `head_ref_force_pushed`, which does
# carry `.actor`, so the exposed case is an ordinary push with no comment, review
# or thread-open in the same window.
#
# The SIBLING cost, ruled the other way on purpose. A `Commit` SUBJECT carries an
# identity but no push time, so `_thread_comments` substitutes the committer date
# and `_window_actor` treats a substituted date outside the window as UNCERTAIN
# rather than absent. The two rulings differ because the evidence differs: a
# `committed` row is positively known to name nobody, whereas a commit subject
# whose every readable surface falls outside the window leaves the notification
# itself unexplained, and an unexplained notification is not an empty one.
# Ruling both UNCERTAIN would make every pull request carrying a `committed` row
# permanently uncertain and put the drop out of reach, which is the failure this
# frozenset exists to prevent. Residual exposure: a commit held locally long
# enough that BOTH its dates predate the window still reads as uncertain, so it
# yields a digest row rather than a drop. MEASURED 2026-09-10: 0 of 1488
