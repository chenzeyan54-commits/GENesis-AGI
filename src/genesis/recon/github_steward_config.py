"""Config lever for the GitHub account-activity monitor (the "github steward").

Cloned from ``cc.foreground_reaper_config``: fresh-read-per-call, ``MODES``
tuple + env kill switch, degrade-toward-less-authority on damage.

Modes (increasing authority):
  - ``off``     — the monitor does not run.
  - ``observe`` — poll + record observations + seed the seen-actor set, but
    NEVER ping. First-deploy default: prevents a cold-start ping-storm (every
    existing contributor would otherwise classify as first-time). The operator
    flips to ``live`` once the seen-actor set is seeded.
  - ``live``    — observe + push priority Telegram pings for genuine external
    activity (first-time contributor, security advisory, account notice).

A missing/corrupt config degrades to DEFAULTS; an invalid ``mode`` degrades to
``observe`` (safe: record but never ping — never a silent ``off`` that hides the
feature, never an unattended ``live``). Env kill switch
``GENESIS_GITHUB_STEWARD_DISABLED=1`` forces ``off``.

Generalizability: NO install-specific repo names ship here. ``flagship_repos``
defaults to empty; each install pins its own via the gitignored
``github_steward.local.yaml`` overlay, and an empty list makes the monitor
resolve the owner's active public repos live (capped).

Dependency rule: stdlib + yaml + genesis.env + genesis._config_overlay only.
