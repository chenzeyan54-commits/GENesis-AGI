    This is the reflection read-only denylist (``build_reflection_disallowed``)
    MINUS ``Bash``. It denies file writes, the whole SPAWN class
    (Agent/Task/Workflow/Skill — a spawned child would escape with a fresh,
    unrestricted toolset), the user-scoped MCP servers, and every genesis MCP
    *write* (``memory_store`` / ``settings_update`` / ``follow_up_create`` / …),
    while KEEPING the reads the prompt needs (``memory_recall`` /
    ``procedure_recall`` / genesis-health status reads) and the one write the
    prompt still uses (``observation_write`` — the OPTIONAL ``user_signal`` digest).

    ``Bash`` is deliberately RETAINED: the prompt shells out to ``yt-dlp`` /
    ``curl`` to fetch YouTube (and SSL-failing) inbox URLs. Relocating that fetch
    into Python so ``Bash`` can also be denied is the remaining residual of
    follow-up 727a3724 (the inbox judge's injection→RCE surface). Deriving from
    ``build_reflection_disallowed`` (live per call) means a genesis MCP write
    added in a future PR is auto-denied here with no code change.

    NOTE: the retained ``observation_write`` now STAMPS the session origin (WS-3):
    an eval-session write lands ``origin_class='external_untrusted'`` (like the
    procedural/knowledge writers). Two PRIVILEGED-WRITE consumers are now gated on
    that origin — ``UserModelEvolver.process_pending_deltas`` (user model) and the
    autonomy dispatcher's ``task_detected`` pickup — via
    ``immunity.is_trusted_for_privileged_write``, so a forged
    ``user_model_delta`` / ``task_detected`` is rejected at the point of privileged
    consumption. PARTIAL, NOT the whole vector: the digest types this tool writes
    (``user_signal`` / ``architecture_insight``) are still surfaced UNFILTERED into
    LLM context by other consumers (``essential_knowledge._recent_decisions`` → the
    always-loaded L1 file; ``reflection`` context; several ego/sentinel raw-SQL
    reads). Closing that broader observation-content-surfacing surface (exclude/wrap
    external-origin content at the surfacing points) is tracked — see the
    "external-origin observation content" follow-up. (The ``Bash``/fetch relocation
    remains the open part of 727a3724, above.)
