"""WS-2 P1b — fire-and-forget commit-path writer hooks.

Coverage is mandatory by construction: every action in a starter class writes
its falsifiable prediction(s) at the moment it commits — hooks are code in the
commit path, not LLM discipline. The contract mirrors
``feedback/bus.py::record_outcome``: a hook NEVER raises, never blocks or
delays the action, never touches transaction state on the shared connection.

Failures are counted per action_class (``write_failure_counts`` is read by
``mcp/health/errors._compute_alerts``, which emits
``ledger:write_failed:<class>`` through the M10 awareness-tick alert writer —
the single designated ``alert_events`` persister) and ``logger.error``-ed.
A dedupe ``IntegrityError`` is debug-only, NOT counted: retries and resends
legitimately re-enter commit paths, and the CRUD validates everything else
before its INSERT, so an IntegrityError from this path is the UNIQUE key.
