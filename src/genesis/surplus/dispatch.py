"""Surplus dispatch engine — the single-cycle task dispatch pipeline.

Extracted from ``SurplusScheduler.dispatch_once`` (which remains on the
scheduler as a facade — tests and ``_dispatch_loop`` call it there). The
pipeline is decomposed into named phases with NO logic change:

    dispatch_once
      ├─ _select_executor            registry lookup + default fallback
      ├─ _handle_failure             shared failure path (see ASYMMETRY note)
      ├─ _route_insights             intake routing + quality judge
      ├─ _chain_pipeline             enqueue next pipeline step
      ├─ _bridge_code_audit_findings findings → recon observations
      ├─ _log_brainstorm             brainstorm_log persistence
      └─ _signal_autonomy_success    autonomy calibration signal

Function-scope imports are intentional — they are the tests' patch-target
seam and the import-cycle breaker; do not hoist them to module top.
