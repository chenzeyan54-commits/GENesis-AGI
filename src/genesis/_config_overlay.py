"""Shared helper for merging .local.yaml config overlays.

The dashboard settings system writes user customizations to
``config/{name}.local.yaml``. Each subsystem config loader calls
:func:`merge_local_overlay` after reading the base YAML to pick up
those overrides.

This module is intentionally dependency-free (only stdlib + yaml)
to avoid circular imports from any config loader.

    A finer cache key than :func:`local_overlay_mtime`, and purely additive —
    that function is unchanged, so no existing caller moves.

    The float mtime it returns carries the filesystem's own resolution, so a
    rewrite landing inside one tick is invisible to a cache keyed on it: a
    coarse filesystem, a fast `settings_update`, or an editor or restore that
    preserves timestamps all leave the key unchanged while the file's CONTENT
    changed. A config cache guarded that way serves the old value indefinitely,
    which defeats the point of re-reading config live. `st_mtime_ns` is an
    integer at nanosecond resolution, and `st_size` moves on almost any real
    edit; both come from one `stat()`.

    The INODE is the third part, and it is what covers the case the first two
    cannot: a writer that preserves the timestamp AND lands the same byte count.
    Every atomic write in this repo goes through a temp file and a rename
    (`mcp/health/settings.py::_atomic_yaml_write`), and a restore from backup
    writes a new file too — both change the inode even when nothing else moves.

    Still not a content hash — hashing means reading the file, which is the work
    such a cache exists to avoid. The one shape this cannot see is an IN-PLACE
    rewrite that keeps both the size and the timestamp, which no writer here
    performs; `reset_config_cache()` is the deterministic escape if one ever
    does. This narrows the window; it does not close it, and saying otherwise
    would be the kind of claim this repo keeps having to retract.
