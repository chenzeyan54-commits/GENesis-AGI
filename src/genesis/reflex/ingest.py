"""Reflex ingestion — task.failed / job.failed events → fingerprinted signal rows.

Two afferent sources feed the same pipeline: ``task.failed`` (crashed
``tracked_task`` coroutines) and ``job.failed`` (exception-driven background-job
failures, funnelled onto the bus by the PR-2a job-health path). Only
exception-driven failures are ingested — an event without an ``error_type``
(a semantic/reason-only failure) belongs to the job-health/Sentinel lane, not
the reflex arc.

Two-stage by design (mirrors the event bus's own persistence path): the
bus subscriber only ENQUEUES — the event bus dispatches listeners inline
inside ``emit()``, so a DB commit there would serialize every ERROR+
event behind SQLite contention and compound a failure burst instead of
absorbing it. A dedicated worker (itself a ``tracked_task``) drains the
bounded queue and upserts. Overflow drops are counted, never silent.

Failure containment: the subscriber body and the worker's per-item
processing are each fully guarded — reflex ingestion must never break the
bus or die to one poison item. If the worker task itself crashes, that IS
a ``task.failed`` signal (emitted via its own tracked_task wrapper); the
queue then fills and drops — no recursion, no loop.
