"""Desktop-takeover control surface — the arming lever for real input.

The ONE place :mod:`genesis.autonomy.desktop_gate` consults for policy
(``ledger_shadow_config`` / ``contributor_worklog_config`` lineage):

- :func:`effective_mode` — ``off | shadow | live``, re-read from the merged
  YAML (``config/desktop_takeover.yaml`` + the user overlay
  ``~/.genesis/config/desktop_takeover.local.yaml``) on EVERY call. No boot
  cache: the gate re-reads per action, so a hand edit takes effect on the next
  action with no restart.
- :func:`grant_ttl` / :func:`action_ttl` — the two bounded windows, coerced to
  their safe defaults on any unusable value.

Why the arming path is deliberately awkward: a live desktop grant is the
broadest authority Genesis holds — everything the operator can do at their own
machine. ``mode: live`` alone grants nothing; ``live_opt_in: true`` must be set
as well, so a copied config, a legacy overlay or a single careless edit cannot
hand over the keyboard. Neither key is exposed through ``settings_update`` or
the dashboard (this module is deliberately absent from
``mcp/health/settings.py``): arming is a conscious edit of the gitignored
overlay, never one unconfirmed API call.

Every degradation path here moves toward LESS authority. An invalid mode is
``shadow`` (observable) rather than ``off`` (silently inert) or ``live``.

Kill switch: ``GENESIS_DESKTOP_TAKEOVER_DISABLED=1`` forces ``off`` before any
YAML is read, so a config the process cannot parse is not a way past the stop.

Dependency rule: stdlib + yaml + genesis.env + genesis._config_overlay only.
The gate imports from here, never the reverse (one-way).
