"""Desktop-takeover authorization gate — the deterministic check that stands
between Genesis and the operator's own keyboard, mouse and screen.

This is the largest authority Genesis can hold: while a grant is live, anything
the operator can do at their machine, Genesis can do. The gate decides in CODE,
below the acting model. It is not a permissions prompt the model sees, and no
prose the model writes about its own intent reaches the classifier — the inputs
are the target the actuator RESOLVED (element name, control type, IsPassword
from the accessibility tree, plus the window title and any text to be typed).
Consent inferred from a model's self-report is exactly the weakness this exists
to avoid.

GROUNDWORK (desktop-takeover PR-2): nothing calls this yet, on purpose. The
actuator (PR-1) is inert and the loop, transport and MCP tool land in PR-3. An
actuator with a caller and no gate IS the ungated capability, so the gate ships
first and alone.

Four properties are load-bearing, each independently tested:

1. **Arming takes two keys.** ``mode: live`` AND ``live_opt_in: true``, neither
   reachable through ``settings_update`` or the dashboard. Default is
   ``shadow``: classify, record, refuse.
2. **Authority is per SESSION, MISSION and WINDOW, and must arrive from OUTSIDE
   this box.** A grant is an approved, unconsumed ``approval_requests`` row
   carrying this session's id, this mission's id, the target window's
   ``(handle, pid, lifetime nonce)`` and this module's ``kind``, resolved through
   :data:`DESKTOP_GRANT_RESOLVER_PREFIXES`.

   Every one of those is COMPARED, which is the point. The grant previously
   bound the window by TITLE and carried no mission at all, so two browser tabs
   both called "New Tab" shared one grant, a renamed document stopped matching
   its own window, and consent given for one mission covered any later one. A
   field carried and not compared is a promise the consent card makes and the
   code does not keep. The nonce is there because `(handle, pid)` repeats that
   mistake on the TIME axis rather than the space one: a recycled HWND in a
   still-live process is a different window wearing the same identity.

   The RESOLVER set is deliberately narrower than ``classify_resolver``'s
   "human" class: `dashboard` is stamped by a route
   any local process can reach with the internal token, and `user` is just a
   default. Neither proves a person acted, so neither can mint a grant here.
   A foreground CC conversation cannot mint one either — which is the point.
   The bar closes the APP-LAYER path (a Genesis component using the sanctioned
   approval APIs); it does not make a grant unforgeable by something with
   same-uid write access to the database, which no SQL predicate could. See
   :data:`DESKTOP_GRANT_RESOLVER_PREFIXES`.
3. **A capability cell can DENY desktop control but can never GRANT it.** The
   promotion path is a closed set (PR #1838) that does not contain ``desktop``,
   so no amount of banked evidence turns session consent into standing
   autonomy. The cell exists so the capability is visible in the matrix, and so
   the owner has a permanent off switch.
4. **A hold queues nothing.** Held desktop actions are not resumable: a desktop
   action aims at a screen that has since moved, so on approval the loop
   re-captures and re-plans. The invariant that buys is worth stating plainly —
   *every action executes against an observation taken after the last
   approval.*

Secret fields are outside all of that: ``is_password`` (or a target that merely
looks like a password field) is a REFUSAL with no approval path. There is no
version of this capability that types into a password box.

That last sentence is an absolute, so the thing that could falsify it is worth
naming: a KEY action has NO resolved target by construction — it acts on
whatever holds focus, which the gate cannot see — so ``is_password`` is always
False for a keypress and the secret-field refusal has nothing to match against.
The claim therefore rests on the inert-chord ALLOWLIST admitting no chord that
can INSERT content. ``ctrl+v`` was on that list and is not any more: ``tab`` is
inert, so the loop could reach a password box and paste into it, and the gate
would have called it ordinary input. What a keypress can still do to a focused
secret field is disturb it — backspace, undo — which is why the guarantee is
written as *types into* rather than *touches*.

TWO HONEST LIMITS, restated rather than quietly upgraded by this rewrite:

- **The grant predicate is NOT a complete authorization boundary.**
  ``genesis.db`` is a file writable by the uid every Genesis process runs as,
  so anything with same-uid code execution can INSERT a row satisfying every
  bar here. What the allowlist closes is the APP-LAYER path — a Genesis
  component using the sanctioned approval APIs can no longer mint itself
  desktop authority. Closing the rest needs provenance no SQL predicate can
  express. Do not let the loop in PR-3 be written believing otherwise.
- **The classifier is NOT a defence against adversarial UI.** IDENTITY and
  FINANCIAL are matchers over text the SCREEN supplies, and in this threat
  model the screen is hostile: a malicious page names its own controls and can
  label a destructive one "Continue". Adding the operation, the key chord and
  the reversibility verdict raises the bar on ORDINARY software — it does not
  make this a boundary against a page that is trying. The things that do hold
  there are the grant's own scope and the operator watching their screen.

AND A THIRD, which is new and belongs to this revision:

- **Approving a hold currently authorizes NOTHING.** The row is written, and
  no surface can resolve it: it is excluded from the dashboard queue, refused
  by ``resolve_request``, and excluded from ``approve_all_pending``, because
  desktop consent is meant to come from the purpose-built path that names the
  target window back to the operator — which lands with the loop in PR-3. The
  gate also never calls ``mark_consumed``. So the hold branch records an owner
  decision and stops there, on purpose: what an approved hold should BUY is a
  new authorization surface and needs the same binding discipline as the grant
  itself, and that decision belongs with the consent path that will carry it,
  not ahead of it. Stated here so the next reader finds a deliberate gap
  rather than what looks like a broken approve-then-act loop.

#:
#: Both kinds share ONE action_type, deliberately — a single action_type is
#: what keeps every batch-approval exclusion to a single entry rather than a
#: set someone can half-update. The price is that `kind` is load-bearing: it is
#: the only thing distinguishing "the owner consented to this session" from
#: "the owner approved one click", and the grant lookup MUST filter on it.
SESSION_GRANT_KIND = "desktop_session_grant"

#: ``context.kind`` marking a per-action HOLD row.
#:
#: This exists because ``_hold`` used to write the ACTION_TYPE into the ``kind``
#: field — ``"desktop_takeover_gate"`` where every reader expects a kind. The
#: two strings are different, so the row was well-formed JSON carrying a value
#: no lookup would ever match: the hold path was WRITE-ONLY. It is a distinct
#: constant rather than a reuse so the grant lookup's ``kind`` filter keeps
#: meaning what it says.

#: Wire-format version of a session-grant context blob.
#:
#: An UNKNOWN version is refused, not best-effort parsed. A grant is the

#: the defect class this whole rewrite exists to close.
SESSION_GRANT_VERSION = 2

#: Wire-format version of a per-action HOLD context blob.
#:
#: Same discipline as :data:`SESSION_GRANT_VERSION`, and it exists for the same
#: reason: the hold blob is written NOW for a reader that lands with the consent
#: path, so it is a forward-compatibility commitment — and a commitment with no
#: version is one the future reader cannot refuse. The moment that reader adds
#: or re-means a field, rows written by this version become indistinguishable
#: from rows written by the new one.
DESKTOP_HOLD_VERSION = 1

#: Resolver prefixes that may mint a desktop SESSION GRANT. A deliberate
#: narrowing of :data:`HUMAN_RESOLVER_PREFIXES`, not a reuse of it.
#:
#: `classify_resolver` answers "was this written by a human-operated channel?",
#: which is the right question for metrics and the wrong one here. `dashboard`
#: is stamped unconditionally by the resolve route, and that route is reachable
#: by ANY local process holding the dashboard's internal bearer token — a file
#: readable by the uid every Genesis process runs as. So `dashboard` cannot
#: distinguish the owner from Genesis, and `user` is merely
#: `ApprovalManager.resolve`'s default, i.e. "nobody recorded who". Neither is
#: proof a person acted.
#:
#: What remains are channels whose MESSAGES originate outside this box: an
#: inbound Telegram callback from the owner's own account, and the voice
#: bridge's spoken resolution.
#:
#: What this bar does NOT do, stated plainly because the obvious reading of the
#: paragraph above is stronger than the truth: it does not make a grant
#: unforgeable. `resolved_by` is a column, and `genesis.db` is a file owned by
#: the uid every Genesis process runs as, so anything with same-uid code
#: execution can INSERT a row satisfying every bar here — including this one,
#: by simply typing an allowlisted prefix into it. That is a property of the
#: whole approval substrate (the autonomous-CLI gate and the email gate rest on
#: the same rows), not of this gate, and closing it needs provenance the SQL
#: predicate cannot express — a signature only the real resolver can produce, or
#: an OS-level identity split. What this allowlist DOES close is the app-layer
#: path: a Genesis component calling the sanctioned approval APIs — the
#: dashboard resolve route, an MCP tool, a background session — can no longer
#: mint itself desktop authority. Do not read it as more than that, and do not
#: let PR-3 wire a caller believing the predicate is a complete boundary.
#:
#: SETTLED 2026-09-07 by the owner, after a security review raised it: a spoken
#: challenge-response MAY open a session-length grant. `voice:` stays. Do not
#: re-raise it on ambient-audio or replay grounds.
#:
#: What that ruling does and does not cover. It settles the POLICY — voice is an
#: accepted consent channel for this capability. It does not assert that the
#: voice pipeline resists replayed or ambient audio, which is unverified and is
#: an engineering property, not a decision. The design already leans on the
#: right mitigation: the consent path NAMES the target window back to the
#: operator and waits for a specific answer, which is materially harder to
#: trigger by accident or replay than a bare "approve" — an attacker would need
#: the window name, and the grant is bounded, revocable and scoped to that one
#: window regardless. PR-3 should build the challenge-response as specified
#: rather than treating a naked "yes" as sufficient.
#:
#: Allowlist, not denylist — a resolver stays unable to grant desktop control

        The action arrives as ONE validated object rather than a handful of
        optional strings. That is the substantive change: the previous
        signature could not carry the operation, the key chord or the window
        handle, so the gate could not tell Ctrl+Enter in a mail composer from
        typing a letter, and could not tell two windows both called "New Tab"
        apart. Those were not gaps in care — the information was not in the
        input type, and no amount of pattern-matching adds information that was
        never passed.

        A call that omits a required field is REFUSED with a reason naming the
        field, never held. A hold would ask the operator to approve an action
        nobody can describe — "something in some window" — and a missing
        required field is a CALLER bug, not a judgement to delegate. Nothing
        calls this gate yet, so that refusal costs nothing today and means the
        loop in PR-3 cannot be built wrong: it has to say what it is doing
        before the gate will act on it.

        The order below is the design, not an accident. Cheap total refusals
        come first; in LIVE mode the first DB WRITE happens only after the
        session grant has been verified, so an unauthorized caller cannot make
        the gate record anything on its behalf. Shadow deliberately writes the
        cell either way — observing is its whole job, and it can never act.
        Classification is pure and therefore runs early, so a refusal names the
        real reason instead of the first tripwire.

        Eight independent bars, each of which has to hold. Every one exists
        because its absence was a defect found in review, not because it seemed
        prudent:

        - **this session** — the grant carries the session id and is filtered on
          it in SQL, so one session's consent is never another's. Compared HERE
          as well, because SQLite says ``'' = ''`` is true: a grant with a blank
          session id would otherwise authorise a caller with a blank one. An
          ABSENT key extracts NULL and never matches, which is exactly why this
          looks safe and is not;
        - **a GRANT, not a hold** — both are rows of the same action_type, so
          ``kind`` is what separates "consented to this session" from "approved
          one click". Without it, approving a single held action silently became
          a full session grant with a fresh expiry;
        - **a KNOWN wire format** — an unrecognised ``version`` is refused
          rather than read optimistically;
        - **this MISSION** — bound to ``mission_id``, never to the mission
          prose. The text is model-generated and is rewritten on every re-plan,
          so comparing it would reproduce the window-title failure one level up:
          consent given for one mission would stop matching the mission it was
          given for, while a differently-worded mission would slip through;
        - **this WINDOW** — ``(window_handle, process_id, window_nonce)``, not
          the title. Two browser tabs are both called "New Tab", so a title bar
          authorises the wrong window while looking strict. But the handle and
          pid together are not enough either, and the reason is the SAME defect
          one level down: they are not unique OVER TIME. A Windows HWND is
          valid for a window's lifetime and is then recycled, and the pid does
          not save it — a browser keeps one process alive across many windows,
          so a new window can receive a closed window's handle and inherit its
          still-live grant. The pair names a handle SLOT; the nonce is what
          names the window occupying it, and the actuator guarantees it changes
          when that window is replaced. The title is still carried, for the
          consent card that names it back to the operator;
        - **approved and unconsumed** — consumption is how a session's grant is
          retired, so a consumed row is a finished session, not a live one;
        - **resolved through an allowlisted channel** —
          :data:`DESKTOP_GRANT_RESOLVER_PREFIXES`, deliberately narrower than
          ``classify_resolver``'s human class. `dashboard` and `user` are NOT
          proof a person acted (see the constant), so they cannot mint a grant
          even though they classify as human elsewhere;
        - **unexpired, bounded both ways** — ``resolved_at`` within the
          configured TTL and not in the future. A grant nobody remembers giving
          must lapse without needing a teardown to run, and a backwards clock
          step must not mint a permanent one.

        The refusal reason names the FIRST bar that failed rather than a generic
        denial, because the owner-facing difference between "you never granted
        this" and "that grant was for a different window" is the whole point of
        asking per window.
