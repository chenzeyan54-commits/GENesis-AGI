        Sleeps a fixed interval and measures how much longer than the interval
        the wake-up actually took — that excess is time the loop spent unable to
        schedule ready callbacks. Drift alone does NOT say why: a synchronous
        frame, a VM pause, a SIGSTOP and cgroup CPU starvation all delay
        ``asyncio.sleep`` identically. When drift exceeds the threshold we log at
        WARNING so the stall is timestamp-correlatable with awareness-tick /
        dispatch / bundle log lines; establishing the CAUSE is the off-loop stack
        sampler's job (util/loop_stall.py). This docstring previously claimed the
        warning names what starves the recall coroutine behind route 503s — it
        cannot, and that claim misdirected a real investigation.

        The WARN also carries ``executor=`` — the default-executor pending depth
        (PR-2c). Read ``pending`` and ONLY ``pending``: a sustained non-zero value
        means ``to_thread`` work is backing up. ``workers`` is NOT an occupancy
        gauge (see util/loop_diag.py) and says nothing about saturation.

        Debounced per stall EPISODE: one WARNING when drift first crosses the
        threshold, one INFO with the peak drift when it clears. A sustained
        multi-minute stall (the worst case, and exactly when log noise competes
        with other diagnostics) would otherwise emit a line every interval.

        Env levers (no restart of the feature's *logic* required to retune):
        ``GENESIS_LOOP_LAG_WARN_MS`` (default 250) — drift threshold to warn at;
        ``GENESIS_LOOP_LAG_SAMPLER`` (0/false/off) — disables the sampler at
        startup. Best-effort: any error ends the sampler without touching serve.
