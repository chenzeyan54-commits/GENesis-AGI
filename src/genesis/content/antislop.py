"""Deterministic anti-slop detection + scrubbing for outbound content.

Ports the mechanically-checkable subset of voice-master's AI-tell audit (the
validated hand-built source at
``~/.genesis/output/skill-evolution/voice-master/antislop_scorer.py``) into the
repo, and adds *fix* logic. Two entry points:

- :func:`detect` — report AI-tell findings without mutating. Code regions
  (fenced blocks + inline code) are excluded so technical text is not
  false-flagged.
- :func:`scrub` — auto-FIX the one safe, unambiguous, fully-mechanical tell:
  an *em dash*, spaced (``word — word``, the #1 AI punctuation tell) or bare
  (``word—word``), rewritten to the prescribed published form, two hyphens
  closed up (``word--word``; owner ruling 2026-09-16 — published prose never
  uses an em dash, which reads typeset rather than typed; conversational
  surfaces keep their em dash and are not scrubbed). Everything else — banned
  words/phrases, cadence,
  and the *ambiguous* dashes (en dash, spaced ``--``, which also occur in number
  ranges, tables, and CLI flags) — is FLAGGED, never rewritten. Removing a word
  or guessing at an ambiguous dash would mangle meaning; real fixing needs
  regeneration.

This is the deterministic half of the anti-slop story: the model's own Step-6
self-audit is unreliable (it emitted spaced em dashes in every test despite the
SKILL.md's loudest rule), so the one mechanical tell is enforced in code on the
outbound path. ``scrub`` never silently degrades meaning — only the
zero-information-loss em-dash rewrite mutates the text.

CLI: ``echo "text" | python -m genesis.content.antislop -`` or
``python -m genesis.content.antislop path/to/file``.
