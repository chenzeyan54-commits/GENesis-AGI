"""Outbound egress gate — deterministic anti-slop scrub + PII scan.

Applied to content destined for an EXTERNAL audience, where the model's own
self-audit can't be trusted and a leak is public-facing. NOT applied to
Genesis talking to the user (Telegram / voice / interactive replies).

Fires when either:
- the delivery channel is external (``email`` / ``discord``), or
- the outreach category is ``content`` — a draft submitted for user review
  before external publishing (so the version the user approves is already
  scrubbed).

Anti-slop (:func:`genesis.content.antislop.scrub`): an em dash (spaced or bare) is
auto-fixed to the published `--` form; the rest is flagged, never deleted. PII (:func:`scan_outbound`):
scanned only for external-DELIVERY channels — a ``content`` review copy headed
to the user is scrubbed for slop but not PII-blocked (it isn't a delivery).
