    source_session: which session this work originated from — the CC TRANSCRIPT
    session id, the namespace every live producer writes and every consumer
    joins on (repo_pulse reads it as ``item_session_id``; charter/dashboard key
    on transcript ids). Three-valued:
      - a string: stored (empty normalizes to NULL — a degraded CC result can
        carry ``session_id=""``, and "" is invisible to IS NULL consumers);
      - None: an INTENDED NULL — the caller resolved provenance and refused to
        substitute (e.g. an unresolvable prefix). Stored as NULL, never
        defaulted away;
      - omitted: defaults from the runtime session ContextVar
        (``observability.session_context``). FORWARD-PROVISION, honestly: at
        this writing NO ``create`` caller runs inside a scoped task tree, so
        the branch has no live producer — and any future producer MUST set the
        ContextVar to the CC transcript id, NOT ``cc_sessions.id`` (today's
        setters store the internal row id, an indistinguishable-but-wrong
        namespace for this column).

    THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT VALIDATE THE ID'S SHAPE, BY CHOICE. The shape check
    (``session_charters.is_full_session_id``) lives at the MCP tool boundary,
    because that is the only place the value is TYPED by a model rather than
    passed through from a store that already holds a full id — the inbox
    evaluator, the task executor and the ledger escalator each forward an id
    they read, and re-validating a value we ourselves stored would buy nothing.
    The column is therefore NOT guaranteed canonical: it already carries four
    16-hex ``ego_cycle`` rows (2026-05) that match no session in any store,
    written before any of this existed. A new DIRECT caller that accepts a
    model- or user-supplied id must apply the predicate itself.
    NOTHING guesses: a wrong id is worse than none — measured 513/513 NULL
    before this existed, while repo_pulse_worker read the column on every row
    it ever annotated.

    kind:     'follow_up' (intended for action) or 'tabled' (tracked, not for action).
    domain:   'internal' | 'user_world' | None (None = not yet classified).
    goal_id:  optional link to a unified goal (user_goals.id) for future promotion.
    dedup_key: optional idempotency key. Callers that may re-run (e.g. inbox
              re-evaluation) pass a stable hash so the same recommendation does
              not create duplicate rows; a partial unique index backstops races.

    """Per-status counts for BOTH lanes of this store, from ONE statement.

    Everything a caller needs to describe this store comes back together, and
    that is the point rather than a convenience. A board assembled from several
    reads of one population can publish figures that were never simultaneously
    true: the connection is shared and releases its lock per database method,
    so a row deleted or reclassified between two SELECTs yields arithmetic true
    at no instant — ``unresolved > total``, or a negative remainder. A single
    aggregate cannot disagree with itself.

    Returns ``{lane: {status: count}}`` for exactly two lanes:
    :data:`LANE_ACTIONABLE` (``kind = 'follow_up'`` — where work is dispatched
    from) and :data:`LANE_DEFERRED` (every other kind). Both lanes are always
    present, empty when they have no rows, so a caller never distinguishes
    "no rows" from "key absent".

    TWO LANES, EACH WITH ITS OWN STATUS MAP, and that shape is the fix rather
    than an elaboration. An earlier version returned ONE status map with the
    deferred rows folded in under a sentinel key: every caller then had to
    strip that key before summing, the two lanes shared a single denominator
    the second one did not belong to, and a deferred row in a terminal status
    was silently counted as outstanding. Separate maps make the denominator of
    each lane derivable from the lane itself, which is the property the surface
    reading these numbers actually needs.

    The deferred lane is a COMPLEMENT (``ELSE``) rather than an enumeration of
    ``tabled``/``idea``: a kind added later lands in it automatically, where a
    named list would drop those rows from both lanes — the exact under-count
    this function exists to prevent. ``kind`` is NOT NULL with a CHECK
    constraint (``db/schema/_tables.py``), so every row falls in exactly one
    lane and none escapes both.

    ``GROUP BY 1, 2`` uses ordinals deliberately. Grouping by an alias binds to
    a real COLUMN of that name if one ever exists, which would collapse both
    lanes into one group silently — verified on SQLite 3.45.1. Ordinals cannot
    be shadowed.
