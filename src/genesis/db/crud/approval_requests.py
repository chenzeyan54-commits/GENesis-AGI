# ``resolved_by`` is free text written by convention, not constraint. This is
# the ONE canonical mapping from resolved_by values to a resolver class —
# consumers (J-9 approvals metrics, dashboards) must use it rather than
# re-deriving prefixes. When adding a new resolved_by writer, extend the
# prefix tuples AND tests/test_db/test_approval_resolver_classes.py (which
# pins every known writer literal and the live-DB value inventory).

    The desktop-takeover gate's session-consent lookup. Returns every match,
    newest resolution first, rather than the single newest row: the caller must
    additionally require an allowlisted resolver and an unexpired grant, and a
    ``LIMIT 1`` here would let one system-resolved row hide an older, valid
    owner approval underneath it.

    ``kind`` is NOT optional and NOT cosmetic. One action_type carries two
    different kinds of row — a session GRANT and a per-action HOLD — because a
    single action_type is what keeps every batch-approval exclusion to one
    entry. Without this predicate the two are indistinguishable, and approving
    one held action silently becomes a full session grant with a fresh TTL:
    the owner consents to one click and hands over the session. MEASURED
    before the fix; regression-tested after.

    The ``json_extract`` calls are guarded by ``json_valid`` inside a CASE,
    which SQLite evaluates lazily. A bare ``json_extract`` raises "malformed
    JSON" on an invalid value, and a bare AND-chain does not promise to
    short-circuit before reaching it — so ONE hand-edited or corrupted
    ``context`` anywhere in the table (the module docstring above names
    one-off manual DB fixes as a real occurrence) made every desktop grant
    lookup raise. MEASURED: an unguarded query against two malformed rows
    raised OperationalError. It failed closed, but a gate that crashes is a
    gate nobody can use.

    Deliberately unbounded: the result is scoped to one action_type AND one
    session id, and a session holds one grant by construction (a fresh row per
    session, consumed at teardown), so the population is a handful of rows.

    Unlike :func:`find_approved_unconsumed` there is no ``resolved_at`` window
    in SQL — the grant's lifetime is a config lever the caller owns, and
    encoding a second, silently different expiry here would give the capability
    two disagreeing clocks.
