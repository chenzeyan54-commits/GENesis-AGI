"""CRUD for ``zero_drop_findings`` — standing stranded-work conditions.

The zero-drop mandate: "what work has fallen through the cracks?" must be
answered by a reconciler that ENUMERATES, never by a session that remembers.
An enumeration is only trustworthy if the same condition seen twice is the
same row twice — that identity, and the recurrence counting built on it, is
what this store holds.

Why a NEW store (New-Store Gate justification, each candidate rejected on a
semantic mismatch, not on taste):

- ``observations`` is prose content with ``skip_if_duplicate`` DROPPING a
  repeat. A detector needs the opposite: a repeat is the signal (it is the
  third consecutive run that makes a stranded branch worth escalating), and
  there is no per-row acknowledgement concept to key on a SHA.
- ``alert_events`` holds exactly one open row per alert id — it models "is
  this alarm ringing", not "which N branches are stranded right now".
- ``reflex_signals`` is the closest SHAPE (fingerprint UNIQUE +
  occurrence_count + first/last_seen_at + muted/dismissed statuses) and this
  schema deliberately adapts it, but that table owns the self-bug-repair
  lifecycle (verdicts, repair attempts); borrowing it would put detector rows
  into a queue that another subsystem drains.
- ``repo_pulse_annotations`` is per-match-EVENT grain (one row per PR↔item
  match), not per-standing-CONDITION grain.

So: a small, detector-owned table. The detector is the SOLE writer of its own
findings and never mutates an authoritative work store (no auto-push, no
auto-PR, no ledger/follow-up writes) — those never-dos are requirements, not
commentary.

Identity is ``(class, branch)``, NOT the tip SHA. A SHA-keyed row would become
a new row on every commit, resetting ``consecutive_runs`` and silently
disarming escalation. The SHA is carried as EVIDENCE (``tip_sha``) and as the
EXPIRY KEY for an acknowledgement (``acked_tip_sha``): an ack means "I looked
at this branch AS IT WAS", so it expires the moment the branch moves.

Retention: only RESOLVED rows are pruned (``prune_zero_drop``, 45d, wired into
``scripts/disk_hygiene.sh``). An ``acked`` row is live SUPPRESSION state —
deleting one would silently un-suppress the finding on the next sweep, so acked
rows are never pruned regardless of age. Open rows are bounded by the branch
count of one install (~150 refs), so there is no unbounded growth to GC.

    ``present`` is every finding of ``class_`` this run saw, each a dict with
    ``branch`` plus any of :data:`_EVIDENCE_COLUMNS` (``details`` as a dict).
    Anything of this class NOT in ``present`` is resolved — which is exactly
    why the caller must only pass a class whose sweep COMPLETED. A degraded
    leg (a failed git call, a capped PR listing) must skip the class entirely:
    a partial sweep that resolved the branches it never looked at would
    manufacture a clean board, the one failure mode this detector exists to
    prevent. There is no half-applied middle state — one commit at the end.

    Lifecycle, per already-known row:

    ``held`` names identities the sweep SAW but could not report on this run —
    an age gate filtered them, or their worktree was unreadable. They are
    neither present nor gone, so they are left exactly as they are. Absence
    from ``present`` otherwise means "gone", and conflating the two destroys
    real state (see the hold branch below for the measured case).

    - ``resolved`` → REOPEN: a new episode. ``consecutive_runs`` restarts at 1,
      ``reopen_count`` increments, ``first_seen_at`` re-stamps, escalation
      clears, and the ack fields clear with them — a reopened row is a fresh
      condition, and a stale ``ack_reason`` sitting on it would read as
      "somebody already decided about this".
    - ``acked`` with a MOVED tip → the ack expires: back to ``open`` with the
      ack fields cleared. A lingering ``ack_reason`` on an open row reads as
      "still suppressed", so nothing is kept.
    - ``acked`` with the SAME tip → stays acked (suppression holds), but
      ``consecutive_runs`` still counts: the counter is a fact about the
      CONDITION, not about whether we chose to look at it.
    - ``open`` → ``consecutive_runs`` increments; at ``escalation_k`` the row
      stamps ``escalated_at`` once. Escalation is VISIBILITY only — nothing
      here pushes, opens, closes or unclaims anything.

    Returns per-run counts: ``{"new", "recurring", "reopened", "expired_acks",
    "escalated", "resolved", "still_acked", "held"}``, plus
    ``duplicate_identities`` only when a collision actually occurred.
