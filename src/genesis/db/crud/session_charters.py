    THREE STORES, ONE QUERY, AND THE UNION IS THE POINT (Codex P2 x3, PR #1622).
    A session's full id can live in any of them, and which one depends only on
    how far through its life it is:

      session_charters   — chartered sessions (post-first-compaction)
      cc_sessions        — dispatched/recorded sessions, chartered or not
      session_heartbeats — written by the UserPromptSubmit hook BEFORE the model
                           runs, so for a newly started foreground session it is
                           the ONLY store holding the id at all

    Asking them in SEQUENCE was wrong in both directions. It MISSED the third
    store entirely, which is the one covering exactly the window where a session
    creates provenance about itself — so the common case stored NULL. And it
    ACCEPTED the first store's single hit as unique without looking further, so
    a prefix matching one chartered session AND a different unchartered one
    returned the charter's id and attributed the work to the wrong session,
    permanently. "Unique" is a property of the union; it cannot be decided one
    store at a time.

    `UNION` (not `UNION ALL`) deduplicates, so a session present in two stores
    is still one answer; `LIMIT 2` is all the ambiguity check needs.

    THE PREFIX IS VALIDATED BEFORE IT BECOMES A PATTERN. It is interpolated into
    a `LIKE`, where `%` and `_` are WILDCARDS — a malformed prefix could match a
    single unrelated row and be written as durable provenance. Session ids are
    UUIDs, so anything outside hex-and-hyphen is not a prefix of one and is

    is rendered by its own session's injection and by nothing else, so once
    that session dies its open rows are unreachable by every process and
    person — and nothing anywhere counted them.

    This is a SUPERSET of the population ``ledger_escalation`` acts on, not the
    same set: :func:`ledger_stale_open` additionally filters by ``added_by``
    provenance and by age. Said precisely because the loose version of this
    sentence ("the population it acts on") would make the two numbers look
    reconcilable when they are answering different questions — this one is
    "how many rows is anyone still carrying?", which had no answer at all.

    A COUNT rather than ``len(ledger_all(...))`` on purpose: the complete read
    exists to state facts about individual rows and raises past a 200k
    tripwire, which is the wrong instrument — and the wrong failure mode — for
    a denominator.
