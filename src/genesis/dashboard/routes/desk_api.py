"""POST /v1/desk/chat/completions — the desktop assistant's brain.

A desktop assistant (a separate, third-party product running on the operator's
own machine) speaks plain OpenAI chat-completions to whatever ``base_url`` it is
configured with. Pointing that at this endpoint makes Genesis the brain behind
it: every turn routes through ``ModelRouter``, so provider choice, cost tracking,
circuit breakers and observability are Genesis's, and the desktop side holds no
model credential of its own.

Distinct from its two neighbours on purpose:

- ``/v1/chat/completions`` (OpenClaw) runs a full ``ConversationLoop`` — a Claude
  Code subprocess per request. Correct for a chat channel, far too heavy for a
  per-utterance desk brain.
- ``/v1/voice/*`` serves one specific edge client with its own tool protocol.

TWO LANES, because the caller's turns are not all the same shape. Desk turns must
follow long instructions exactly (the desktop side triggers its own tools by
emitting an exact control tag, and a near-miss silently fires nothing), while
phone turns are composed mid-call where latency is felt directly. The lane comes
from ``X-Genesis-Lane``, or from a ``-fast``/``-primary`` suffix on ``model`` when a
proxy strips unknown headers — a header alone fails silently and invisibly.

Deliberately NOT a recall path. The caller builds its own system prompt from its
own vault, and Genesis memory reaches it through the explicit ask-Genesis tool,
not by injection here — two context builders fighting over one prompt is how
both end up wrong. That is also why ``suppress_dead_letter`` is set: a dead-letter
row would persist the caller's vault-derived prompt in ``genesis.db`` for 72h and
re-dispatch it against a paid chain, for a reply nobody will ever read.

KNOWN CONTRACT LIMITS, stated so they are a contract rather than a surprise:
streaming is refused outright; ``role: "tool"`` and function/tool-call turns are
refused (the router has no tool protocol); and IMAGE content is refused, because
Genesis's routing layer carries no multimodal support at all — answering a
"what am I looking at" turn from the text alone would be a confident answer about
something never seen, which is worse than an error.

# "3 x 30s < 110s" is the arithmetic for three ATTEMPTS, and a retry profile
# multiplies attempts per provider — so the bound has to hold for the retried
# case, not the happy one.
#
# Note what does NOT threaten it, because the obvious worry is the wrong one: a
# per-attempt TIMEOUT is classified TIMEOUT and fails fast without retrying
# (routing/router.py, the fast-fail category set), precisely so a timeout cannot
# be multiplied. The case that does spend the budget is a provider failing
# SLOWLY without timing out — a 503 returned at ~25s is TRANSIENT, and under
# ``user_facing`` (max_retries: 2) that is three goes at the same dead provider
# before the chain advances.
#
# Both desk call sites therefore use ``desk_interactive``, which drops the
# transient retry too: for an interactive turn the next provider is worth more
# than another go at the one that just failed, and the budget can buy one or the
