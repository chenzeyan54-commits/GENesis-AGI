"""The two bench arms — CCInvocation builders and the memory-tool policy.

Fairness contract: both arms get the SAME model, effort, task prompt (with the
same envelope), tool budget (built-ins fully enabled), timeout, and sandbox.
The only deltas are the treatment under test: Genesis identity (system prompt)
and read-only memory recall (genesis-memory MCP against the run's DB snapshot).

Bare-arm recipe (every piece probe-verified 2026-07-09):
  - ``--safe-mode`` — the ONLY OAuth-compatible way to suppress the user-level
    CLAUDE.md (CC discovers it via the passwd-resolved home, ignoring $HOME and
    $CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR; ``--bare`` refuses OAuth outright).
  - clean CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR whose only entry is a SYMLINK to the real
    ``.credentials.json`` (defense-in-depth for settings isolation; the
    symlink lets OAuth token refresh write through — a copy would rotate the
    refresh token and break the real install).
  - neutral empty cwd per task (no project CLAUDE.md), strict empty MCP.

# a conscious read/write classification fails CI.

#: Read-only recall surface the Genesis arm keeps. "Read-only" holds because
#: the recall path's own usage write-backs are suppressed via
#: GENESIS_MEMORY_WRITEBACKS_OFF in the bench MCP env (see isolation.py) —
#: without that seam, memory_recall/memory_core_facts mutate prod Qdrant.

# session's final message — the judge grades exactly that.
#
# The out-of-bounds rule exists because the arms run on Genesis's own host:
# in the 2026-07-10 pilot the BARE arm answered a recall task by running
# `find / -iname "*CLAUDE.md"`, grepping ~/genesis, and reading a CC-memory
# backup file — context contamination through the filesystem, caught only by
# the judge-rationale audit. A prompt rule is the v1 mitigation (both arms,
# identically); host-level sandboxing (e.g. bwrap) is the principled fix and
# is tracked for the >=20-task scale-up. The synchronous-work rule exists
# because both arms once returned "waiting for a workflow" placeholders as
# their final message (background work outliving the session).
