    """Hybrid search: Qdrant vectors + FTS5, RRF fusion, with optional graph enrichment.

    Routing: for ingested docs/APIs use knowledge_recall, for credentials/URLs
    use reference_lookup, for learned procedures use procedure_recall.
    memory_recall with source='both' searches everything but without
    domain-specific filtering or credential audit logging.

    Args:
        source: 'episodic' | 'knowledge' | 'both' | None. Defaults to
            ``'both'`` — searches episodic and knowledge_base collections.
            Knowledge results below a score floor are filtered to reduce noise.
            Use ``knowledge_recall`` MCP tool for knowledge-base lookups,
            or pass ``'both'`` / ``'knowledge'`` explicitly if needed.
        compact: If True, return lightweight previews only (memory_id, preview,
            score, wing, room, memory_class, source). Use memory_expand to
            fetch full content for specific IDs. Saves tokens and ~500ms.
        wing: Filter results to this structural domain. Controlled vocabulary —
            one of: autonomy, career, channels, dev_workflow, employment,
            general, infrastructure, integrations, learning, memory, research,
            routing. Enumerated here, as `life_domain` below is, because this
            docstring IS the schema the caller sees: an unlisted value is
            refused, and a caller that can be told the valid set should not
            have to learn it by failing a call.
        room: Filter results to this topic within a wing.
        life_domain: Filter by life domain: "personal", "employment", or "genesis".
        include_graph: If False, skip graph traversal (saves ~500ms per call).
        expand_query_terms: If True, expand the FTS5 query via tag co-occurrence
            analysis (~500ms first call, ~10ms cached). Broadens recall for
            ambiguous queries. Default on — catches poor query formulation.
            Note: does not apply to the drift_recall fallback path (if wired).
        mode: Retrieval mode. "auto" = standard + drift fallback (default).
            "standard" = hybrid only, no drift fallback. "drift" = skip
            standard recall, use 3-phase drift retrieval directly. Drift
            mode ignores wing/room filters (discovers clusters dynamically).
        time_range: Explicit date range filter as "YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD".
            Queries the SVO event calendar and boosts temporally matching
            memories in RRF fusion. Automatic temporal detection also runs
            on queries with temporal language (e.g., "what happened last week").
        include_subsystem: Subsystem-filter additive mode. ``False`` (default)
            excludes automated-subsystem writes (ego corrections, triage
            signals, reflection observations). ``True`` returns everything.
            A list (e.g. ``["ego"]``) augments user content with the named
            subsystems. Mutually exclusive with ``only_subsystem``.
        only_subsystem: Subsystem-filter replace mode. Return ONLY rows
            tagged with the named subsystem(s); user content excluded.
            Used by ego's own self-recall path.
        rerank: If True, apply Voyage AI cross-encoder reranking after RRF
            fusion. Improves precision by rescoring candidates on semantic
            relevance. Adds ~300ms latency. Default True — disable with
            rerank=False for latency-sensitive calls.
        include_deprecated: If True, include superseded/deprecated memories
            in results. Default False — only current (non-deprecated) memories
            are returned. Use True for audit/history queries (e.g., tracing
            how a belief evolved over time).

    Every MCP tool that accepts a `wing` must call this — all three of
    `memory_recall`, `memory_store` and `memory_synthesize` do. A caller that
    can be told the valid set should be told it: a silent coercion here teaches
    nothing, and this parameter has been reported as "not exposed" by an agent
    that never tried it. `MemoryStore.store()` coerces instead — see the
    comment there for why the two tiers differ.

    One definition of validity, two failure SHAPES, chosen by direction. The
    WRITE tools let this ValueError propagate: a rejected write must not look
    like a completed one. The READ tool (`memory_recall`) catches it and
    returns `[{"error": ...}]`, matching how its sibling `life_domain` filter
    already reports a bad value in the same function. Raising there would be
    the louder choice but not the better one — recall returns a list, and an
    exception is a harsher failure mode than the empty-looking list it exists
    to explain.

    Guarding one tool and not its sibling just moves the door: all three
    agent-facing tools write or filter on the same `memory_metadata.wing`
    column, and `classify_life_domain()` returns "personal" for an unknown
    wing, so one bad value corrupts a DERIVED field too. That holds regardless
    of how many bad rows exist at any moment.

    An earlier revision justified this with a row count ("18 of ~81k rows …,
    17 of those 18 have `dream_cycle_run_id IS NULL`, so they came through
    THIS boundary"). Retracted, not merely restated: re-measured 2026-09-03,
    no wing-bearing table holds ANY out-of-vocabulary row, no store is ~81k,
    and `dream_cycle_run_id` is NULL for every row in `memory_metadata` — so
    that column discriminates nothing and the provenance inference never
    followed from it, whatever the counts had been. The mechanism argument
    above needs no corpus, which is why it replaces rather than supplements
    the number.

    The supersede on its own, when the correction is ALREADY stored. Use it
    when you are linking two memories that both already exist, or whenever you
    know both ids up front — it is the direct way to say "this one replaces
    that one".

    It does NOT say "use this when ``memory_store(supersedes=...)`` told you the
    deprecation failed", because that tool cannot tell you: ``store()`` catches
    a failed deprecation and still returns only the new memory's id, so no such
    report reaches this boundary. Saying otherwise described a recovery the
    caller can never be prompted to make.

    Both arguments accept the same short ``id:<8-char>`` handles the proactive
    hook prints and ``memory_expand`` accepts; an ambiguous handle is never
    guessed.

    Nothing is written unless every check passes, so a REJECTION costs
    nothing and is safe to retry once you have corrected the ids. It raises
    rather than returning a verdict, because there is no stored content whose
    fate you would have to interpret alongside the error — that asymmetry is
    exactly why this exists as its own tool.

    Rejected, with nothing changed:
      * either id naming no memory, or a prefix naming several
      * ``old_id == new_id`` — a memory cannot replace itself
      * a ``new_id`` that is itself deprecated OR already temporally invalid
        (past ``invalid_at``) — normal recall filters both out, so the
        correction would be unreachable while the target went away

    One failure is NOT a rejection: ``SupersedeIncomplete`` means the SQLite
    deprecation committed but a mirror (the Qdrant payload or the
    ``succeeded_by`` link) did not. Retrying the SAME call is safe and is the
    repair — every step is idempotent. Do not treat it as "nothing happened":
    the old memory is already deprecated for keyword recall, and the retry
    finishes the vector/graph half.

    Args:
        old_id: The memory being corrected. Marked deprecated.
        new_id: The memory that replaces it. Must exist and be live.

    drops garbage + non-intentional knowledge_base and ``kb_slots`` caps KB — so
