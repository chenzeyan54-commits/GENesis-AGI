    The message is delivered AS-IS — Genesis does not rewrite or rephrase it.
    Compose the exact text you want the recipient to see (this is the tool for
    reminders and literal notifications).

    For email replies, pass thread_id to route to the correct recipient.
    The thread_id maps to a registered email thread whose recipient is
    used for delivery.

    **Discord: name the CHANNEL, not the adapter.** Pass
    ``channel="announcements"`` (or any name in ``DISCORD_CHANNELS``) and it is
    routed to that channel. ``channel="discord"`` still works and goes wherever
    ``OUTREACH_RECIPIENT_DISCORD`` points, which defaults to ``dev-discussion``.

    That default is why this exists. The pipeline has always supported steering
    a Discord send (the recipient IS the webhook name), but this tool exposed no
    way to say which channel — so every caller asking for "Discord" got
    dev-discussion, silently, including a release announcement that belonged in
    announcements. A caller could not tell it had been redirected: nothing
    errored, and the log line recorded the REQUESTED name.

    That fallback is gone. A channel with no configured webhook is now REFUSED
    with an error naming the setting to add. The refusal is correct, expected
    behaviour and not a fault to work around: configure the named setting, or
    send to the default channel. Do not retry it — the condition is permanent
    until an operator changes configuration.

    message is only addressable by the id its ``outreach_send`` call returned, so
