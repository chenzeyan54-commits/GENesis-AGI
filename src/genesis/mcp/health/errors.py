    a 3-day provider outage read exactly like a 3-minute one (incident
    2026-08-28/29). Enriching the MESSAGE reaches the dashboard banner, the
    morning report and the Telegram path at once, because all three render
    `message`.

    Mutates in place. An alert firing for the FIRST time has no row yet (the
    awareness tick writes it after this runs), so it simply gets no suffix.

    KNOWN LIMIT, declined deliberately rather than patched (Codex P2): the only
    writer of `alert_events` is the awareness tick, so if that loop dies no new
    open rows appear and alerts first detected afterwards stay undecorated no
    matter how long they persist. The fail-soft behaviour is correct — no suffix
    is the honest output when the outage clock has no data.

    A fallback start time was considered and rejected: the only clock available
    without that writer is "when this process first saw the alert", which resets
    on every restart. That is precisely the flapping this whole change removes,
    and a duration that silently understates the outage is worse than none
    because it reads as current. A second persistence path would be a new store

    #    which latches RATE_LIMITED on CCInvoker errors but has flapping
    #    protection that can suppress the auto-recovery transition. Net
    #    effect: the state machine can stay RATE_LIMITED for long periods
    #    even when background sessions are healthy and the hourly budget
    #    says otherwise. The background budget tracker (bg.status) is the
    #    source of truth for actual throughput state. Cross-check before
    #    emitting — if the budget tracker disagrees, the state machine is
    #    stale, suppress the alert.
    #
    # 2. Severity is WARNING, not CRITICAL. Rationale: the Sentinel is
    #    the only CRITICAL-alert responder, and the Sentinel's only tool
    #    is dispatching a CC session. If CC is genuinely unavailable, a
    #    diagnostic CC session cannot run. Waking the tool to fix the
    #    tool is a self-defeating loop. WARNING routes to Tier 3
    #    (reflexes only) per the classifier — the user still sees it on
