    """Staleness verdict for ONE heartbeat-emitting subsystem.

    Reads the latest durable ``heartbeat`` event for *name* AND the in-memory
    event-bus ring, uses the FRESHEST of the two, and compares its age to the
    subsystem's overdue threshold in :data:`HEARTBEAT_EXPECTED`. Returns the same
    per-subsystem shape :func:`_impl_subsystem_heartbeats` yields:
    ``{status: alive|overdue|paused|no_heartbeat|unknown, last_seen, age_seconds?}``.

    *db* defaults to the health service's connection; a caller with its own
    runtime connection (e.g. the ego dashboard route) passes it explicitly.

    *raise_on_error*: by default a caught query error is ERROR-logged and the
    verdict degrades to ``no_heartbeat`` (best-effort, as the display/alert paths
    want). A caller that renders a POSITIVE health assertion (the ego tile) passes
    ``True`` so the read failure RE-RAISES and it can fail loud (surface unknown)
    rather than paint a healthy tile over a broken read. (Truly unexpected
    exception types always propagate — matching the original display behavior of
    surfacing ``is_error`` rather than silently dropping a real bug.)

    *paused*: for a :data:`_PAUSE_GATED_HEARTBEATS` subsystem (surplus/inbox,
    whose pulse stops behind their loop's ``if paused: return``), a would-be
    ``overdue`` verdict while Genesis is globally paused is downgraded to
    ``paused`` — a deliberately-paused subsystem is not a dead one. ``None`` (the
    default) reads the live global pause flag; callers may pass an explicit bool
    (tests, or a caller that already read it). Non-pause-gated subsystems
    (ego/dashboard) pulse THROUGH pause, so an ``overdue`` for them is a real
    death and is never downgraded.

    An unknown *name* (not in the threshold table) → ``no_heartbeat``; never raises
    for that reason.
