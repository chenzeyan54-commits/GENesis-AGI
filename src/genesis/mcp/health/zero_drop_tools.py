"""zero_drop_status / zero_drop_ack — the read and disposition surfaces.

The detector answers "what work has fallen through the cracks?" by
enumeration. These are the two things that makes it worth having: a way to
READ the enumeration, and a way to DISPOSITION a row that is meant to sit
there.

The disposition half is not optional. The design deliberately has no
branch-name denylist — a backup or scratch branch is acknowledged with a
written reason instead, so the judgement is a record somebody can read rather
than a rule nobody can see. Without an ack surface that decision has no
expression, and a handful of permanent, undispositionable findings escalate
and stay in every alert forever, which is precisely how a signal dies.

The read half carries three things no count can be trusted without: the
detector's own last-run age (a stale zero is not a measured zero), which
classes the last run actually SWEPT (a frozen class reports leftovers), and
whether any leg is currently blind.

    """Assemble the board. Untrusted repository text reaches a model here.

    Two kinds of field, treated differently on purpose:

    - ``branch`` is the ACK KEY. Callers pass it straight back to
      ``zero_drop_ack``, so it must round-trip byte for byte — neutralising it
      would merge two identities onto one key, which is a correctness bug worse
      than the problem it addresses. It is therefore emitted VERBATIM, and
      paired with ``branch_display``, which is not.

      The structural argument this docstring used to make for emitting it bare
      was FALSE, and false in the one direction that mattered. It said git
      refuses a ref name containing a control character, a space or any of
      ``~^:?*[`` — true — and concluded that a branch name therefore cannot
      carry anything deceptive. It can. ``check-ref-format`` says nothing about
      the Cf (format) category, and MEASURED 2026-09-13 on git 2.43 it ACCEPTS
      a branch whose name contains U+202E (right-to-left override), U+200B
      (zero-width space) or U+2066 (bidi isolate). Those render as nothing, or
      reorder the text around them, so a crafted local ref could make the
      branch a reader SEES differ from the key they are acknowledging — while
      this module's own ``_safe_identity`` classifies exactly those characters
      as unsafe (Codex P2, PR #1794).

      Hence three fields rather than one: the verbatim key, a neutralised
      ``branch_display`` safe to render, and ``identity_unrenderable`` so a
      reader is TOLD when the two differ instead of having to notice. Not
      quarantined the way a hostile worktree identity is — a quarantine there
      refuses to create a key, whereas here the finding already exists and
      dropping it would hide real stranded work to avoid an awkward name.
    - ``worktree_path`` and the ``degraded`` blob are DISPLAY, not keys.
      Nothing passes them back, and a filesystem path (unlike a ref name) may
      contain anything at all, so both are neutralised here.
