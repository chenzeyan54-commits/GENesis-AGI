"""settings tools — read and modify Genesis configuration via conversation.

Exposes 3 generic tools: settings_list, settings_get, settings_update.
Each config domain has its own validator. Writable domains use atomic
YAML writes (tempfile + rename). Read-only domains are enforced by the
registry, not by filesystem permissions.
