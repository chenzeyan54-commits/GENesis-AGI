    """Tell a conversation session what it currently IS, and that it can change it.

    Two failures this closes, both MEASURED on a Telegram DM session 2026-09-02.

    1. The session was asked to "switch to Opus, medium effort" and replied that
       it could not change its own model. It could: `session_config` has existed
       on the health MCP since long before, its docstring literally says "Call
       when the user asks to switch models ('use opus', 'switch to haiku')", and
       `GENESIS_SESSION_ID` — the id that tool needs — was in its environment.
       It had even run `env` and seen that variable 31 seconds earlier. No
       capability was missing; the session simply held a false belief about
       itself. A tool the model does not know it has is not a capability.

    2. The model/effort a session believes it is running are stated ONLY in the
       fresh-session system prompt. A resumed turn sends no system prompt, so
       after any /model or /effort switch the session's self-description goes
       stale and stays stale for the life of the conversation.

    Both are fixed by re-stating the CURRENT values every turn, which is why this
    rides `--append-system-prompt` alongside `--resume` (the same delivery the
    topic-context block uses) rather than living in the assembler — an assembler
    change would reach fresh sessions only, i.e. it would have missed the very
    turn that failed.

    Deliberately NOT a natural-language intent matcher. The failure was
    self-knowledge, not parsing: no pattern over the USER's words would have
    corrected a model that believed the capability did not exist.

    Scoped to OWNER-ATTENDED channels via ``origin_delivery_supported`` — i.e.
    Telegram today. That predicate was written for a different purpose (can a
    background result be delivered back here) but it is the correct one here for
    an independent reason: it is the same "the owner is on the other end" test.

    Withheld everywhere else, deliberately:
    - TERMINAL: the human already has Claude Code's own /model and /effort, and
      a terminal resume carries NO system prompt at all (an invariant
      test_second_message_resumes pins).
    - WEB (OpenClaw): `/v1/chat/completions` is registered with NO auth gate and
      the invocation is stamped supervised=False, origin=external_untrusted.
      Telling THAT session it can switch its own model — and never to refuse —
      hands an anonymous caller a lever the user is supposed to own. Quality
      over cost is the USER's tradeoff to make.
    - VOICE / WHATSAPP: no ConversationLoop call sites exist for them today.
