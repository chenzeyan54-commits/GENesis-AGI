    Wraps the CC subprocess in a transient systemd scope with resource
    limits.  Each session gets its own cgroup under app.slice/run-XXXX.scope,
    separate from genesis-server.service.

    Memory limits are PERCENTAGES so they scale with the host: systemd
    resolves ``N%`` against the container's memory cgroup (verified: on a
    16 GiB container ``62%``→9.9 GiB soft, ``75%``→12 GiB hard). This keeps
    a heavy CC build from OOM-ing the box while auto-scaling up on larger
    installs and down on the 8 GiB floor — no hardcoded ceiling to re-tune.

    Returns an empty list if systemd-run is unavailable (graceful degradation)
    OR has no reachable user manager. The probe matters: ``which`` alone is not
    enough — an env-scrubbed spawner (some agent CLIs' shell tooling, CI
    runners, a stripped systemd context) has the binary but no
    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS/XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, and ``systemd-run --user`` then
    dies instantly with "Failed to connect to bus", taking the CC subprocess
    down with it at 0.0s. Measured on a live install.
    Same probe-then-commit pattern as .claude/mcp/run-codebase-memory, and the
    probe sets the SAME properties as the real invocation (`_SCOPE_PROPERTIES`)
    so a property the manager rejects fails at probe time rather than on every
    dispatch afterwards.

    Caching is asymmetric and lives in `_get_scope_args`: a SUCCESS is cached
    for the process lifetime, a FAILURE only until a backoff elapses. Set
    ``announce`` False on a retry so a permanently-unscoped box logs the
    warning once rather than on every re-probe forever.

# FAILURE is not, and the difference is the whole point. The old comment here
# ("they don't change during a process's lifetime") was written when this
# guarded a deterministic `shutil.which` result. It now guards a PROBE, which
# can fail transiently: a timeout under load, or `systemd --user` restarting
# during an update. genesis-server is long-lived, so caching one such failure
# forever silently drops MemoryHigh=62%/MemoryMax=75% from EVERY subsequent CC
# subprocess, for days — on a swapless box, which is the exact scenario the
# scope exists to prevent (see _build_scope_args). The degradation is announced
# once in a log line and then never re-evaluated, so the fail-open outlives its
# cause.
#
# The retry schedule ESCALATES rather than repeating at a fixed interval,
# because the two documented failure causes have opposite lifetimes. A user
# manager bouncing during a deploy resolves in seconds to minutes — worth
# re-probing soon. An env-scrubbed spawner with no reachable bus
# (_build_scope_args's docstring) is a PERMANENT property of that box, and a
# fixed 300s retry would probe it forever and log a warning 288x/day, turning
# a once-per-process announcement into noise. Escalating recovers fast from the
