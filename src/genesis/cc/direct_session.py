"""DirectSessionRunner — directed background CC session spawner.

"Run this prompt, report back." No task decomposition, no adversarial
review, no surplus routing. Profile-constrained CC session with
tool-level safety enforcement. Results delivered via Telegram.

Profiles restrict tool access via CC's ``disallowed_tools`` mechanism,
which removes tools from the model's view entirely (validated: CC strips
them from the init tools list).

Design notes (from architect review):
- Uses a *dedicated* CCInvoker instance (not the shared one) because
  ``_active_proc`` is not concurrency-safe under Semaphore(2).
- Accesses ``outreach_pipeline`` lazily via runtime ref (not injected at
  init time) because outreach init runs after cc_relay in bootstrap.
- Never calls ``should_throttle`` — this is user-invoked work, not
  autonomous background compute. Cost control is the user's decision.
