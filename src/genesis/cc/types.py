# CC's spawn/escape-class tool names — the single source of truth for the restricted CC
# sessions where spawning would escape the parent's tool restrictions: reflection (fully
# read-only), the inbox/mail judges, the experimentation completion, sentinel-degraded.
# (The inbox/mail judges are spawn-hardened here but NOT yet fully read-only — they still
# leave Bash / MCP writes on external input; that boundary is a separate tracked
# follow-up. Surplus is NOT here: its live executor runs via the tool-less Router, not a
# claude -p session.)
# Each of these lets a CHILD escape the lockdown with a fresh, unrestricted toolset
# (Bash/Write/Edit):
#   Agent    — spawns a subagent (the CURRENT Claude Code tool name; registered in
#              util/tool_bootstrap.py CC_TOOLS, matched by the PreToolUse hook in
#              .claude/settings.json).
#   Task     — the OBSOLETE name for Agent, retained so a re-introduction is also denied.
#   Workflow — orchestrates/spawns subagents (reachable inside background sessions —
#              see .claude/docs/background-sessions.md).
#   Skill    — invokes a skill, some of which run in a subagent.
# NOT applied to ``cc/direct_session`` (its ``research`` profile runs a DOCUMENTED
# deep-research Workflow — .claude/docs/background-sessions.md) or the autonomy-executor
# sessions; those legitimately spawn/orchestrate and need a separate design (a
# sandbox-preserving Workflow, or an accepted-porousness decision) — tracked follow-up.
# Blocking the bare tool name removes it from the model's context entirely — and only
# --disallowedTools removes a tool (--allowedTools does NOT, under
# --dangerously-skip-permissions; verified empirically 2026-08-07 via the init-event
# tool list). Home is this leaf module so every site can reference it with no new
# import edge (all denylist sites already import from genesis.cc.types).
