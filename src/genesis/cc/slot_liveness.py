"""Is an interactive `claude` actually running inside a tmux slot?

`cc-slot.sh` attaches to an existing `cc-N` session with `tmux new-session -A`.
When the session already exists, tmux ATTACHES and **silently discards the
shell-command argument** — so the launch command never runs. A slot that is
alive but sitting at a bare shell prompt is therefore self-perpetuating: every
subsequent connection lands at that prompt, and the door has no way to notice.

This module answers the one question the door needs before it decides whether
to attach or to relaunch.

WHY NOT ``#{pane_current_command}``
-----------------------------------
It is the obvious signal and it is WRONG here, which is worth recording because
it reads as correct. MEASURED on a live install, all five sessions:

    session  pane command shape                     pane_current_command  claude?
    cc-4     bash -c "cd … && claude …; trailer"    bash                  YES
    cc-5     bash -c "cd … && claude …; trailer"    bash                  YES
    cc-6     login shell, claude typed by hand      claude                YES
    cc-7     legacy `exec claude`                   claude                YES
    lobby    login shell, idle                      bash                  NO

The canonical pane command is a NON-interactive `bash -c`, and it deliberately
dropped `exec` so the exit-capture trailer can run after claude returns. Without
job control, claude shares the shell's process group, so tmux resolves the tty's
foreground group to the group LEADER — the shell. The two sessions that report
`claude` do so only because they are the legacy/manual shapes. In other words
the signal is wrong for exactly the sessions the launcher creates, and reading
it would classify a healthy slot as broken.

FAIL DIRECTION
--------------
Deliberately biased toward reporting ALIVE. A false ALIVE costs a plain attach —
which is the pre-existing behaviour, so nothing is lost. A false POISONED makes
the door type a launch command into a pane where a session IS running, i.e. into
a live TUI. The two errors are not symmetric, and every ambiguity resolves the
cheap way.

That is also why this does not reuse ``observability/cc_slots._is_interactive``:
that predicate treats an unreadable cmdline as NOT interactive, which is correct
for its purpose (never let an internal `claude -p` masquerade as a slot) and
exactly backwards for this one.

Reads only `comm` and `cmdline` under `/proc` — both world-readable for the
same uid. Never `environ`, which is ptrace-gated and returns EACCES under a
hardened service sandbox.

    this module can hold, and being wrong costs a live session.

    a false ALIVE for a command that merely mentions the entry script without
