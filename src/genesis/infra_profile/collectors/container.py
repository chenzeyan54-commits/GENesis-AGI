"""Container-plane fact collectors.

Every collector takes injectable filesystem roots (``proc_root``, ``sys_root``,
``etc_root``) defaulting to the live paths — the test seam: tests point them at
fixture trees instead of mocking ``open``.

Facts vs metrics discipline (see ``types.py``): facts must be deterministic
across runs on an unchanged system. Lists are emitted in a defined order
(mounts by mountpoint, interfaces by name, flags sorted) so the section hash
only moves when the system actually changed.

Subprocess timeout rationale: these are raw subprocess calls inside a
boot-path task with no external watchdog — a hung ``systemctl`` would hold the
refresh lock forever. All the commands here complete in well under a second on
a healthy system; 15s tolerates heavy load while still releasing the lock.

    Generalised from a specific defect on purpose. The narrow question ("is -500
    applied?") is retired — a user manager can never apply a negative value — but
    the CLASS is what went unnoticed for as long as the declaration existed:
    ``OOMScoreAdjust`` is written by the manager at exec, and when the write is
    refused it fails **SILENTLY**. No journal entry, no start failure, and
    ``systemctl show`` keeps reporting the DECLARED value, so every surface agrees
    with the unit file while the kernel disagrees with all of them. MEASURED
    2026-09-08 on genesis-server: declared -500, effective 100.

    ASK SYSTEMD FOR THE DECLARATION; do not parse unit files. An earlier version
    read ``~/.config/systemd/user/<unit>`` directly and was wrong in both
    directions, because systemd's effective declaration also includes ``.d/``
    drop-ins and runtime ``systemctl set-property`` overrides. Reimplementing that
    precedence would be re-deriving systemd's own config resolution — the manager
    already computes it, so ask it.

    INSPECT THE MANAGED UNITS, not this process. The earlier version read
    ``/proc/self``, but ``refresh()`` is shared by the server, the CLI and a
    separate health-MCP process: a refresh from any of those sampled a process
    that is not a genesis unit at all, returned None, and — because the posture
    check treats None as silent — could AUTO-RESOLVE a standing divergence alert.
    It also never inspected any unit other than whichever one happened to refresh.

    Units with ``MainPID=0`` (not running) are skipped: there is no effective
    value to compare, and a stopped unit's declaration cannot be wrong yet.

    MEASURED across this install's live units: 7 checked, 6 agreeing, 1 divergent
    — the 1 being the real defect. The 6 agreeing all DECLARE nothing and are
    reported by systemd as 200 (its default), and they RUN at 200, so an unset
    unit is not a false alarm.

    True when every checked unit agrees, False on the first genuine divergence,
    None when nothing could be checked (no systemctl, no running genesis units,
    unreadable /proc) — the posture check treats None as silent, per the
    explicit-False-only contract.
