        A ZERO-WIDTH window (start == end) means quiet hours are DISABLED, which
        is the shipped default (``config/outreach.yaml``).

        ``ego/cadence.py::_in_quiet_hours`` has the same zero-width rule, but the
        two are NOT equivalent and an earlier version of this docstring said they
        were: ego checks an explicit ``quiet_hours_enabled`` flag FIRST
        (``cadence.py:1466``) and its zero-width rule is a fallback underneath
        that. Here the sentinel IS the off switch. A boolean would be immune to
        the overlay hazard noted in ``config/outreach.yaml``; it is deliberately
        deferred (owner ruling 2026-09-10) and tracked with the proper redesign.

        Without the early return the equal case falls into the ``start <= end``
        branch and compares a microsecond-precision ``now`` against midnight —
        effectively but not reliably never true, which is a worse kind of "off"
        than an explicit one. The one instant where it matters is midnight
        exactly, which is what ``test_midnight_is_the_instant_the_rule_actually_
        decides`` pins.

        The check lives HERE rather than in ``check()`` deliberately: both
        ``tests/test_outreach/test_governance.py`` and the autouse
        ``_disable_quiet_hours`` fixture replace this whole method, so a check one
        level up would bypass their control of it.

        A MALFORMED window disables quiet hours rather than raising. This method
        is called from ``check()`` on every send, and ``scheduler.py`` retries a
        failed drain indefinitely — so an unparseable value used to turn one typo
        into a permanent 5-minute failure loop. Nothing validates the field today
        (the settings domain has no validator and the dashboard PUTs the config
        through unchecked), and this change is what invites the owner to edit it,
        so it fails toward the safe direction: the owner still gets their
        messages, and the bad value is logged rather than swallowed silently.
