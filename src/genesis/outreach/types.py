# ── External-vs-owner outreach: which rows count toward engagement ───────────
# Engagement metrics ("how much of our outreach got a reaction") must measure
# EXTERNAL outreach only. If the denominator counts owner-facing housekeeping,
# the ratio collapses toward zero (the 2026-08 strategic-reflection artifact:
# ~71 of ~79 rows were relay housekeeping, so engagement read ~0% while real
# external content had normal reactions).
#
# CHANNEL — not category — is the reliable signal. Category is overloaded:
# 'notification' is an owner ping on Telegram but a genuine PROSPECT reply on
# email (MAIL_REPLY.md); 'content' spans Discord posts (external) and Telegram
# content-review drafts (owner-facing). But every message Genesis sends TO ITS
# OWNER — approvals, digests, blockers, alerts, reflections, review drafts —
# goes out over Telegram or voice (HA TTS spoken in the owner's home — the owner
# IS the recipient; see pipeline.py egress-gate + shadow_gate.py), while genuine
# external touches go to Discord / email / (future) other public channels. So the
# owner surface is the Telegram and voice channels.
#
# We EXCLUDE the owner-facing channels (rather than allowlist external ones), so
# a NEW external channel counts automatically. The tradeoff: a NEW OWNER-facing
# delivery channel (e.g. a future owner-directed email digest) MUST be added
# here, or its rows would be miscounted as external outreach.

#: Discord SUB-CHANNEL names. The outreach pipeline routes by ADAPTER name

#: there, because `check_external_io.py` line-greps those names and this module
#: is not an egress door.

#: Lives here rather than in scheduler.py because it now has two readers — the
#: campaign scheduler and `outreach_send` — and two copies of a list like this
#: is a defect waiting for someone to add a channel to one of them.
#:
#: Adding a name here is not enough on its own: with no per-channel webhook for
#: it the adapter falls back to the DEFAULT webhook, which posts to the DEFAULT
#: channel rather than failing — the reason a caller can believe it targeted one
#: channel and hit another.
