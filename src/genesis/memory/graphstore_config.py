"""Which GraphStore answers memory-graph reads.

Failure posture, stated up front because every branch here degrades in the same
direction: anything unreadable, unrecognised, or unset selects ``networkx`` --
the store that has always answered. This lever can only ever move reads ONTO a
new backend deliberately; it can never strand them on one by accident.

That asymmetry is the whole point. The FalkorDB store is faster to keep current
(no rebuild) but depends on a running server, a projection, and a client
library. NetworkX depends on nothing but the process it lives in. When in
doubt, the fewer moving parts win.

Dependency direction matches its sibling `entity_adjudication_config`: stdlib +
yaml + `genesis.env` + `genesis._config_overlay` only. `mcp.health.settings`
imports MODES from here, never the reverse.

    Follows the house pattern (`channels/tts_config.py`,
    `perception/confidence.py`) but keeps the parts as a TUPLE rather than
    summing them: a sum can collide when one file moves forward by exactly what
    the other moves back, which a backdated write can produce.

    NANOSECONDS AND SIZE, not a float mtime alone. `st_mtime` is a float whose
    resolution is the filesystem's, and a rewrite that lands inside one tick —
    a coarse filesystem, a fast `settings_update`, an editor or a restore that
    preserves timestamps — leaves the key unchanged, so the cache would serve
    the OLD mode indefinitely against a file that had actually changed. That is
    the failure this cache must not have: the module's whole contract is that a
    lever change takes effect on the next traversal. `st_mtime_ns` is an integer
    at nanosecond resolution and `st_size` moves on almost any real edit; both
    come from the same `stat()` already being made, so the guard costs nothing
    it did not already cost.

    Still not a content hash, deliberately — hashing would re-read the file,
    which is the work the cache exists to avoid. This narrows the window rather
    than closing it, and `reset_config_cache()` is the deterministic escape for
    a caller that knows it just wrote.

    Two stat() calls guard the parse. MEASURED 2026-09-07: the parse is ~1.8ms

    because `effective_mode()` is called once per recall RESULT inside the loop
    at `mcp/memory/core.py:452-457`, and the uncached read cost roughly as much
    as the NetworkX traversal it selects -- while being charged to `query_ms`
    and drawn from the 500ms graph budget, so it reduced how many memories got
    graph neighbours at all. On the DEFAULT path, for a backend not selected.

    Correcting the rationale this docstring used to give for having no cache: it
    claimed a cache would defeat `dream_centrality` picking up a mode change on
    its next run. That reasoning named the one caller it cannot apply to --
    `centrality_scores` is pinned to the NetworkX store and never consults this
