"""Memory-graph facade — picks a backend, owns the public read surface.

The traversal and centrality logic now live behind the ``GraphStore`` seam
(``memory/graphstore.py``); this module is what the rest of Genesis imports. It
owns the single production store instance, because ``invalidate_graph_cache()``
is called by every ``memory_links`` writer — 13 call sites across 9 modules at
the time of writing — none of which holds a store reference, and several of
which hold no database handle either.

Fallback: the recursive CTE at the bottom of this module, reached on ONE
condition — the active store raised ``GraphUnavailableError``. A cold cache is
NOT a trigger, though this docstring said so for years: the store's first query
builds its projection and returns it. Worth stating precisely, because the wrong
version made the fallback sound routine when it is in fact dormant on a healthy
install — which is how the two paths were free to disagree unnoticed.

Backend today: ``NetworkxGraphStore`` — the in-process MultiDiGraph projection,
unchanged. When NetworkX cannot be imported at all, ``traverse`` still degrades
to the recursive-CTE fallback exactly as before; ``centrality_scores``
deliberately does NOT degrade — it raises, because its consumer (the importance
shield) treats "unavailable" and "empty" oppositely.

The seam exists for the graph-DB adoption (issue #1641): a server-backed engine
becomes another ``GraphStore`` and this facade's selection changes, with no
reader touched. The four readers are ``mcp/memory/core.py`` (recall enrichment
and ``memory_expand``), ``memory/drift.py``, and ``memory/dream_centrality.py``.

    """Original recursive CTE traversal (fallback).

    The walk this mirrors is `graphstore_nx._bfs_with_strength` — it lives
    behind the seam now, not above this function, and these two implementations
    answering differently is exactly what must not happen.

    ONE ROW PER MEMORY, picked the same way the NetworkX walk picks: shallowest
    depth, then the strongest edge reaching it, then link_type as a deterministic
    tie-break. That is not tidiness — it is the same correctness property this
    module's walk exists to provide, and the fallback used to contradict it.

    `SELECT DISTINCT target_id, link_type, depth, strength` keeps one row per
    COMBINATION, not per memory, so a node reached through two parents at the
    same depth came back TWICE — once credited its strongest edge and once its
    weakest. `mcp/memory/core.py` takes `traversal.nodes[:5]` and does NOT sort
    it — the order this function emits IS the selection — so the duplicate both
    occupied two of those five slots and dragged a false weaker strength into
    what the model reads. Which implementation answers must not change that.

    The window's ORDER BY mirrors that walk's `(strength, link_type)` maximum
    exactly, and the outer `ORDER BY depth, strength DESC, target_id` mirrors the
    walk's committed sequence — `(-strength, memory_id)` within a level,
    preserved through a stable final sort on `(depth, -strength)`. That matters
    because `drift.py:202` reads this sequence as a RANKED list for RRF without
    reading a single label, so two implementations agreeing on every field and
    disagreeing on order still hand that consumer different answers.

    The trailing `target_id` is EXPLICIT, not load-bearing, and the distinction is
    measured rather than assumed: with three equal-strength neighbours inserted in
    a deliberately adversarial order (z, a, m), this query returns them id-sorted
    WITH the key and identically WITHOUT it — the window's `PARTITION BY
    target_id` already groups them that way. So no test can tell the two apart,
    and none claims to. It is kept because that is a property of one engine's
    query plan, which SQLite does not promise, and stating the order costs
    nothing; do not read it as a guard something exercises.

    Window functions need SQLite >= 3.25 (2018); this install runs 3.45, and the
    repo already hard-depends on 3.35+ elsewhere (`UPDATE…RETURNING`,
    `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` in migrations 0010/0014/0016), so this floor sits
    strictly below an existing one and cannot newly break a clone.

    Carries the SAME visibility predicate as the graph stores — a degraded path
    that showed the model memories the primary path hides would be worse than
    the degradation itself. Expressed in SQL here (rather than reusing
    ``invalid_memory_ids``) because the traversal is recursive; the cost is
    bounded by the edges actually walked, not the whole table.

    GUARDS ON THE ANCHOR, because the anchor row skipped constraints both the
    recursive step and the walk apply — one generator, several symptoms. Two of
    them are described here; the visibility clauses above are the others:

    * `target_id <> source_id`. The walk seeds `visited = {root_id}` and can
      therefore never emit the root; the anchor had no such guard, so a memory
      linked to itself was returned as its own related memory, burning one of the
      five slots `core.py` shows. MEASURED on the live table: 30 of 269,757 rows
      are self-links, so this fired for 30 roots.
    * `max_depth < 1` returns early (below). The anchor emits depth 1
      unconditionally, ignoring the bound that walk's `while depth < max_depth`
      respects — so `max_depth=0` asked for nothing and got a level. Inert today
      (no caller passes 0; production passes 1, 2 or the default 3) and closed
      anyway, because the claim being made here is that the two paths agree.
