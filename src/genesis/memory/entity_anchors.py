"""Mechanical code-anchor extraction — regex only, zero LLM, zero ambiguity.

Anchors are exact identifiers whose norm_name IS the identifier: repo
file paths, dotted ``genesis.*`` symbols, PR numbers, commit SHAs. They
feed the entity layer from ``MemoryStore.store()`` (every write path)
and power the anchor-revision belief-updater (E5): anchor's file/symbol
gone from the code index ⇒ candidate for ``invalid_at``.

Deliberately conservative patterns — a missed anchor costs a hop, a
false anchor pollutes the graph. Prompt keywords / activity logs are
NOT sources in v1 (content + provenance beat breadth).

    """Resolve + mention every anchor in *content*. Returns count.

    ``db_path`` names WHICH database to own a connection to; ``None`` resolves
    ``genesis_db_path()`` at call time. A PATH and not a connection, and the
    distinction is the whole point of this function: taking the caller's
    connection is exactly what reintroduces the shared-``SerializedConnection``
    hazard described below, so ownership stays here while the TARGET stays the
    caller's to choose.

    It exists because ``scripts/entity_backfill.py`` supports ``--db`` to run
    against an arbitrary database — a copy, a restored backup — and dropping the
    old positional connection without replacing the target would have sent every
    anchor write to the live default instead, silently and while reporting
    success against the file the operator named (Codex P2, PR #1653).

    Writes run on a DEDICATED ``get_raw_db()`` connection under a single
    ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` … ``COMMIT`` envelope — NOT the caller's shared
    ``SerializedConnection``. On the shared connection the lock releases between
    ops (``db/connection.py:106``), so a CONCURRENT tool call's ``commit()`` /
    ``rollback()`` could durably commit or discard this batch's partial writes
    mid-run; an owned connection gives real single-writer isolation and never
    touches another coroutine's transaction.

    Best-effort + failure-isolated by the caller (``store()`` wraps this in a
    suppress); it only touches the entity tables. Every anchor is a MECHANICAL
    type (``entity_registry.MECHANICAL_TYPES``), so ``resolve_entity``
    short-circuits to a single fast ``create_entity`` — no difflib fuzzy match
    runs inside the write lock, so the ``BEGIN IMMEDIATE`` hold stays short. No
    app-level lock retry: an owned ``get_raw_db`` already waits out the standard
    ``busy_timeout``, and a rare BUSY beyond it just drops these anchors (the
    caller's suppress), which is acceptable for a best-effort enrichment.
