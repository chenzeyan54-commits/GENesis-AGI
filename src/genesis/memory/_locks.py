"""Per-memory-id async locks — serialize concurrent mutations of ONE memory.

SQLite and Qdrant share no transaction, so operations on the same memory can
interleave and leave the two stores disagreeing:

- ``MemoryStore.delete()`` removes the point then cascades the SQLite rows;
- ``EmbeddingRecoveryWorker`` re-embeds a pending row then upserts the point;
- the reconcile lane re-reads a lying mirror then re-queues it for re-embed.

A delete landing *between* another path's "is this memory still here?" check and
its point write resurrects a vector the user deleted as a metadata-less ghost —
and ghosts DO surface in recall (the retriever assembles raw Qdrant payloads
without a metadata-existence join) until the reconcile lane sweeps them. These
process-local per-id locks make each memory's delete atomic against its
re-embed/requeue, closing that window within one process.

Scope is exactly one ``memory_id`` — different memories never contend, so this
adds no cross-memory serialization. PROCESS-LOCAL ONLY: the recovery worker and
reconcile lane run in genesis-server, but ``MemoryStore.delete()`` ALSO runs in
the separate genesis-memory MCP process (``reference_delete``; ingest stale-point
cleanup), which this lock cannot serialize against — that cross-process window
is closed by the delete-intent tombstones (PR-2), not this lock. A crash
*between* the point write and the SQLite commit is likewise a separate (rare)
window covered by the reconcile lane.

Covers the delete-vs-{re-embed, reconcile-requeue} triad — the paths that can
RESURRECT a deleted vector — plus the standalone ``MemoryStore.supersede()``,
which holds BOTH its ids from validation through the mirror writes so a
concurrent delete or supersession of the successor cannot commit between its
check and its write. The ``store(supersedes=...)`` path's ``_mark_superseded``
remains deliberately NOT wrapped: it cannot resurrect a vector (a
``set_payload`` on a missing point is a no-op), and its one residual race — a
dangling ``succeeded_by`` link for a concurrently-deleted memory — needs an
existence-guard on the link insert, not just this lock (tracked separately,
pre-existing).

Deadlock-free by construction: every holder takes at most ONE id-lock at a
time and never nests — with a single sanctioned exception: ``supersede()``
takes exactly TWO, always acquired in sorted-id order, and a fixed total
acquisition order cannot form a cycle (it also rejects an equal pair before
locking, so it never nests the SAME lock). ``store()`` takes no lock, and the
slow embed happens OUTSIDE the worker's locked section.

What a lock IS held across is the Qdrant mirror call — ``delete()`` has always
done this (retrieve + delete inside its lock) and ``supersede()`` now does it
holding two. That is bounded by the client timeout rather than unbounded, but
it is not free: a hung Qdrant blocks deletes of both ids for that long. An
earlier version of this paragraph claimed no lock was ever held across an
unbounded wait, which read as a guarantee that neither function kept.
