"""Build the FalkorDB projection of the memory graph. Explicit, not scheduled.

    python -m genesis.memory.graphstore_project

Why this exists as its own entrypoint: selecting the falkordb store with no
projection built makes EVERY root absent from the graph, and the seam is
entitled to read an absent root as "no neighbours" rather than as a failure.
`FalkorGraphStore.traverse` refuses that reading (it raises when the graph holds
no nodes at all), but a store nothing can populate would be unusable — so the
lever's documented precondition needs something that can actually satisfy it.

Automating this is F3's job (debounced on the `memory_links` dirty signal, with
a generation watermark). Until then a projection is a deliberate act, and this
is it. Safe to re-run: the projection is built under a staging key and swapped
in atomically, so readers see the previous projection until the new one is
complete, and never a partial graph.

Reads SQLite read-only via `mode=ro` — WAL-aware, so a projection started while
the server is writing still sees committed rows. Never `immutable=1`, which
ignores the -wal and would silently project a stale snapshot.

    # without the expected tables raises `sqlite3.OperationalError` straight
    # through it, so the operator-facing command answered a routine mistake —
    # an unset or wrong `GENESIS_DB_PATH` — with a stack trace. The engine and
    # the database are both "the projector could not reach what it needs", and
    # this command has exactly one way to say that.
