"""First-party vs external-world provenance labels for recalled memory.

Genesis distinguishes FIRST-PARTY memory (its own observations, decisions, and
conversations — the ``episodic_memory`` collection) from EXTERNAL-WORLD
knowledge (ingested docs/APIs/papers and other content pulled off the world —
the ``knowledge_base`` collection). When KB content enters an LLM context it
must be labeled as external so the self-model never mistakes scraped knowledge
for its own ground truth (audit finding D12).

The authoritative discriminator is the Qdrant **collection** a memory was
retrieved from — always known at retrieval time, unlike the per-item store-time
``source`` string. These helpers turn that signal (plus the already-stored
``source_pipeline`` provenance) into a human/LLM-readable label.
