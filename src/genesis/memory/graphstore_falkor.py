"""FalkorDB-backed GraphStore — the server-side engine behind the seam.

SQLite remains the system of record. This store answers reads from a DERIVED,
rebuildable projection of ``memory_links``; losing it costs a re-projection and
nothing else, which is why nothing here is backed up.

Three dialect facts were MEASURED against the live engine (module 4.20.4) on
2026-09-07 rather than read from documentation, because the documentation is
wrong about one of them:

1. A variable-length relationship variable binds as an Edge, NOT a List, so
   ``ALL(x IN l ...)`` throws at EVERY length -- including ``*2..2``. Only the
   NAMED-PATH form works. This is not a style preference; the other form fails
   unconditionally.
2. FalkorDB has NO temporal types. ``RETURN datetime(...)`` answers
   ``Unknown function 'datetime'``, even though docs.falkordb.com's own Cypher
   coverage page lists Date/DateTime/LocalDateTime as supported in two places.
   Timestamps are therefore mirrored as NUMERIC epoch seconds, which the
   Neo4j->FalkorDB migration guide also prescribes.
3. The engine refuses queries for ~0.9s while loading a snapshot
   (``BusyLoadingError``). That is UNAVAILABLE, never empty -- see the seam's
   contract, which this store exists to honour.

The visibility predicate is applied at QUERY time over mirrored node properties
rather than at projection time. That is a deliberate improvement on the NetworkX
store, which filters at load and therefore cannot notice a future ``invalid_at``
that has since passed (``graphstore_nx`` documents that gap: 114 memories carry a
future ``invalid_at``, 4 of them with edges). Here the projection carries the
timestamp and every read re-evaluates it against a live ``$now``, so a memory
that expires by the CLOCK becomes invisible the moment it does, with no write
event needed.

That improvement covers the time half of the predicate ONLY, and the other half
runs the other way -- stated here because an earlier version of this paragraph
claimed the whole predicate and was wrong. ``deprecated`` is SNAPSHOTTED into the
node at projection time, so a memory deprecated AFTER the last ``project()``
stays visible here until the next one, while the NetworkX store hides it on its
next rebuild (its writers rewire links, which fires ``invalidate()``). Setting or
clearing an ``invalid_at`` post-projection is the same shape. So against the
incumbent this store is FRESHER on elapsed time and STALER on every write, and
the second half is bounded only by how often the projector runs -- see
``invalidate()`` below, which is the honest statement of that bound.

#: projection batch ~0.33s, a full projection 12.4s.
#:
#: READ bounds a user recall. `mcp/memory/core.py:451` gives the graph

#: deadline is the ONLY bound.)
#:

#: p50 2.5ms / p95 5.5ms / max 9.5ms, cold connect+query 13.8-25.6ms. So 0.5s is
#: ~80x p95 and kills no real traversal. But timing out degrades to NetworkX,
#: and that is NOT faster: the NetworkX store rebuilds whenever its cache is
#: dirty, MEASURED at ~3.6s against this install's 269k links, and at 1,610
#: links/day it is dirtied roughly once a minute — so a fallback usually pays
#: the rebuild, and `core.py:459` charges it to the SAME 500ms budget. Between
#: roughly 0.5s and 3.6s of engine latency this deadline makes the recall
#: SLOWER than waiting would have.
#:
#: That band is accepted deliberately: an engine 80x past its p95 is

# projector always writes the property (0 of 72,262 live nodes lack it), so this

        ``db`` is unused: unlike the NetworkX store, the validity predicate is
        answered from properties already in the projection rather than from a
        SQLite read per traversal. It stays in the signature because it is the
        seam's contract, and because a future store may need it.

        The reported strength is the strongest LAST hop among the shortest paths
        reaching a node — best-parent-wins.

        THE INCUMBENT NOW AGREES, and this paragraph used to say the opposite.
        When this store was written the NetworkX walk marked a node visited
        through whichever parent the queue reached first, so the two backends
        agreed on the node SET and could disagree on a multi-parent node's
        reported label. That was true until 2026-09-09, when the walk became
        level-synchronous best-parent-wins and this branch picked it up in the
        reconcile with main.

        RE-DERIVED against the merged walk rather than assumed: both take the
        maximum `(strength, link_type)` over the whole LEVEL, so both credit a
        node its strongest reaching edge; and both emit `(depth, -strength, id)`
        — the walk by committing each level in `(-strength, id)` order beneath a
        stable sort on `(depth, -strength)`, this store by sorting on all three
        explicitly. Same rule, same order.

        So the cutover precondition this docstring used to state as OPEN is MET.
        The label-divergence counts an earlier revision carried (13/400 top-5,
        240/400 reported strength, MEASURED 2026-09-08) were measured against the
        PRE-merge walk and no longer describe anything — they are removed rather
        than restated, because a stale measurement in permanent record reads
        exactly like a current one.

        THE hazard this closes, and it arrives from the opposite side to the one
        the seam usually guards. The contract blesses "a root absent from the
        graph yields [] — genuinely no neighbours, not unavailability". An
        UNBUILT projection makes every root absent, so selecting this store
        before running `project()` answers [] for every memory in the system:
        the engine is perfectly reachable, so nothing raises, nothing falls back
        to NetworkX, and nothing logs. `mcp/memory/core.py` then sees an empty
        traversal and simply omits `graph_neighbors`, showing the model a memory
        with no connections. The health probe declines to catch it by design (a
        reachable engine with an empty projection is a healthy engine), so this
        is the only place that can.

        Consulted on EVERY empty traversal, deliberately unlatched. An earlier
        version cached "the projection exists" for the process lifetime, which
        reintroduced the very defect this method closes: the engine holds NO
        persistence (`--save "" --appendonly no`, so its unit says the graph is
        a rebuildable projection), and a traversal against a MISSING graph key
        returns an empty result with NO error — both MEASURED on the live engine
        2026-09-07. So after an engine restart under a long-lived server, the
        client reconnects transparently, every traversal answers empty, and a
        latched check would never look again: every memory would read as having
        no connections until the SERVER process restarted. The latch saved
        0.70ms (p95 0.91ms) on the empty path only — 0.14% of the 500ms graph
        budget — which is not worth a silent outage.

        EXISTENCE, NOT POPULATION, and the difference is a real install. Node
        count answers the wrong question: on a fresh or fully pruned install
        `memory_links` legitimately holds zero rows, so a perfectly good
        projection of an empty graph counted zero and reported itself as never
        built — the facade then fell back and logged a warning on every
        graph-enriched recall, about a backend that was representing the empty
        graph exactly right. It also contradicted the seam's own contract, which
        blesses an empty graph as an answer.

        A MARKER NODE, and the two obvious alternatives are both wrong. Key
        existence looks right and is not: MEASURED on the live engine 2026-09-08,
        a read-only `MATCH` against a MISSING graph key CREATES that key, so by
        the time an empty traversal asks, the traversal itself has materialised
        it and `EXISTS` can only ever answer 1. (Checked in isolation, `EXISTS`
        does distinguish the two states — which is exactly how that fix passed a
        probe and failed against the engine. The isolated fact was true; the
        inference about the sequence the code runs was not.)

        So `project()` writes one `:ProjectionMeta` node as its last act before
        the swap, and this asks for that. Present -> a projection was built, and
        an empty result is the honest answer for a graph that really is empty.
        Absent -> never built, or the engine restarted and lost it (it holds no
        persistence), or a read just conjured a blank key. The marker carries
        `built_at` because F3's projector wants exactly this number for staleness
        reporting, and a second mechanism for it would be one too many.

        `:ProjectionMeta` is not `:Memory`, so it cannot appear in a traversal:
        `_TRAVERSE` binds both endpoints as `:Memory`.

        ``deadline`` is the caller's REMAINING budget, not a fresh one. This is
        the second query an empty traversal makes, and giving it an independent
        `_READ_TIMEOUT_S` meant an empty answer could cost twice the ceiling.
        A budget already spent is itself the answer — the engine is too slow to
        confirm anything, which is unavailability — so it raises rather than
        borrowing more time.

        WHAT THAT COSTS, stated rather than left for a reader to derive. Every
        link insert and delete calls this (`db/crud/memory_links.py` among 13
        sites); the NetworkX store answers by marking itself dirty and rebuilding

        because a stale projection is indistinguishable from a current one from
        the engine's side.

        The bound on that window is the projector's cadence, and the projector is

        DB-side change signal that would give write-level freshness is filed and
        unbuilt (issue #1641), and is F3's second slice.

        None of it is reachable today: the lever defaults to `networkx`

        BUILD-THEN-SWAP, and the alternative is why. Projecting in place means
        `DETACH DELETE` followed by ~12.8s of batched writes, during which a
        concurrent traversal sees an empty, node-only, or half-edged graph and
        returns a SHORTER answer — never an error. Same failure as an unbuilt
        projection, reached while the store is correctly configured. So the new
        graph is built under a staging key and swapped in with a single RENAME,
        which is atomic from a reader's side: a reader sees the old projection
        or the new one, never a partial. MEASURED on the live engine 2026-09-07,
        including that the id index rides along with the rename.

        SERIALISED TWICE, because there are two different collisions and one
        lock cannot see both.

        IN-PROCESS (`_project_lock`): the staging key is per-PROCESS, so two
        coroutines projecting the same key in one process share it — and with
        the whole-build cleanup, the loser's cleanup wipes the winner's staging
        mid-build, after which the winner writes its marker and renames a
        PARTIAL graph that reads as complete. That is the shape F3's in-server
        scheduled projector introduces, closed here rather than left to a future
        PR remembering `max_instances=1`.

        CROSS-PROCESS (`_acquire_publish_lock`): two projector PROCESSES get
        DIFFERENT staging keys, so they never corrupt each other's build — and
        then both rename onto the canonical key. Publication order is decided by
        who finishes LAST rather than who read newer data, so a run that read an
        older snapshot and built slowly overwrites a newer projection and walks
        the live graph BACKWARDS until something projects again. An asyncio lock
        is invisible across processes; the ordering has to live in the engine
        both of them already talk to.

        A refused claim RAISES rather than waiting. Waiting would mean holding a

        An UNPARSEABLE non-null value takes SQLite's answer, not "never

        read it as unparseable-therefore-NULL kept it VISIBLE. Same memory, two

        so nothing prevents it.
