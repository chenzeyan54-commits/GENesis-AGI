    # A provider that hung past its timeout. NOT retried against the same

    # still records the failure so a repeatedly-hanging provider trips OPEN.
    TIMEOUT = "timeout"
    # A rate-limit (HTTP 429). Expected provider backpressure, NOT a health
    # failure: the router fails fast to the next chain member and the breaker
    # does NOT trip (the per-provider rate gate is the right brake — tripping
    # would take a reachable provider offline for every other call site).
    RATE_LIMITED = "rate_limited"
    # A deterministic client-side error (HTTP 400/422: context-overflow,
    # content-policy, malformed/unprocessable request). No same-provider retry
    # and the breaker does NOT trip — it's our payload's fault, not the
    # provider's health, so tripping would wrongly take a healthy provider down.
    BAD_REQUEST = "bad_request"
    # An entitlement 403: the credential authenticates fine, but THIS account
    # tier may not use this model. Distinct from both neighbours on purpose,
    # because it needs one behaviour from each and neither alone is right:
    #   - like PERMANENT, it must fail FAST (no same-provider retry). MEASURED
    #     2026-09-05: the retry stack cost ~11.9s avg / 19.2s max per exposure
    #     (n=15) sleeping on a provider whose answer could not change, against
    #     a 180-600s aggregate `max_total_s` — i.e. a few percent of the walk's
    #     budget each time it is reached, not the whole of it.
    #   - like QUOTA_EXHAUSTED, it takes the LONG breaker cap — an entitlement
    #     does not change in 30 minutes.
    #     BE PRECISE ABOUT WHAT THAT BUYS, because the obvious reading is wrong.
    #     `_effective_open_duration()` is `min(open_duration_s * 2**(trip-1),
    #     cap)`, and every provider in config/model_routing.yaml sets
    #     `open_duration_s: 120`, so the two curves are:
    #        long cap  [120, 240, 480, 960, 1920, 3840, 7680, 14400]
    #        short cap [120, 240, 480, 960, 1800, 1800, 1800, 1800]
    #     IDENTICAL for trips 1-4. They diverge at trip 5 and only reach the
    #     nominal 8x at trip 8 — roughly 4.2h into a CONTINUOUS outage. And
    #     `load_state` caps `trip_count` at 3 on restart (circuit_breaker.py),
    #     so any deploy or crash resets the escalation to the shared part of the
    #     curve. A freshly-tripping entitlement-dead provider is therefore held
    #     out for exactly as long as a PERMANENT one; the long cap is a
    #     saturation property, not a first-failure one.
    #     (Cross-model review, 2026-09-06 — the earlier wording here claimed the
    #     8x as though it applied from the first trip.)
    # Classifying it as either one alone gives up the other half. MEASURED:
    # `mistral-large-latest` returned this continuously from 2026-08-27 while
    # its "not available in your subscription tier" message matched
    # `_QUOTA_KEYWORDS` and bought it the retry-with-backoff path.
