"""Provider failure escalation — creates observations when providers fail persistently.

Subscribes to the event bus for breaker.tripped events. When a provider
trips its circuit breaker N times without recovery, creates a high-priority
observation so the ego picks it up in its next cycle.

The listener MUST be fast (event bus awaits listeners sequentially).
Observation creation is deferred via tracked_task (failures land on the
event bus as task.failed — the reflex nerve — as well as in the log).

    """Notify for every provider whose unresolved outage has passed the floor.

    THIS REPLACES the trip-driven notification path, and the replacement is the
    point rather than an implementation detail.

    "Has this outage lasted an hour" is a CLOCK question. Answering it from
    `breaker.tripped` events made the answer depend on TRAFFIC: the check fired
    at the 5th trip is below `_NOTIFY_AFTER_S` by construction, so delivery
    relied on a later trip arriving — and if traffic to that provider stopped,
    the user was never told at all. That one mismatch generated four defects
    across four review rounds, each fixed in isolation and each replaced by the
    next: starvation when trips stop; a replacement outage marked notified by an
    in-flight task; a gate that a restart reset; an in-memory anchor with no
    decay that, once backdated, fabricated multi-day durations.

    None of those are reachable here, BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by guarding:
    this function holds no state between calls, consults no in-memory flag, and
    is driven by a clock instead of by traffic. Dedup is `skip_if_duplicate`,
    which is a single ``INSERT … WHERE NOT EXISTS`` statement (see
    `db/crud/observations.py`) and therefore race-free ACROSS PROCESSES — a
    strictly stronger guarantee than the per-process flag it replaces, and one
    that survives a restart, two overlapping sweeps, and a process dying
    mid-write.

    The provider name comes from the row's own content JSON. A row whose content
    is not JSON, or carries no provider, is SKIPPED rather than guessed at: the
    notification hash derives from the provider name, so a row we cannot
    attribute is one we cannot notify about without risking naming the wrong
    provider to the user.

    Returns the number of notifications actually written.
