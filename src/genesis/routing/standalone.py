"""Standalone router bootstrap for MCP child processes.

MCP servers run as CC child processes without a fully bootstrapped
GenesisRuntime.  This module provides a lightweight router that can
make LLM calls via litellm without requiring a database connection,
event bus, or resilience state machine.

The full router in the genesis-server process is unaffected -- if
rt._router is already set, create_standalone_router() is a no-op.
