"""Detached zero-drop detector — the sweep loop.

Spawned fire-and-forget at SessionStart boundaries (and once a day by
disk-hygiene, so a box that starts no sessions still sweeps). It enumerates
local branches, their remote presence, full PR history and every worktree's
uncommitted state, classifies what is STRANDED, and reconciles that against
the findings store.

Why a SIBLING worker and not a repo-pulse lane: the pulse worker holds
ledger-absorb authority (``ledger_update``/follow-up completion) on live
connections. Mounting a detector inside it would put a read-only observer
inside a process that can rewrite the work stores it observes. This one can
write exactly one table plus its own state files, and that is the whole of its
authority.

The never-do list, in force by construction — the detector NEVER pushes,
fetches, opens/closes/reopens a PR, deletes a branch, unclaims work, or writes
to the ledger, follow-ups, tasks or observations-as-work. Escalation
(``consecutive_runs >= k``) sets a visibility flag and nothing else.

Discipline (repo_pulse_worker / ledger_worker lineage):

- Own short-lived DB connections; the server's SerializedConnection is never
  touched. Failures are recorded, never raised — nothing is attached to read a
  detached process's exit status.
- Global flock (``detector.lock``): the loser exits immediately.
- Debounce under the lock; a debounced worker exits silently.
- **A degraded leg freezes its classes.** If the PR listing fails or caps, or
  ls-remote fails, the branch classes are not reconciled AT ALL that run — not
  partially. Only a class swept COMPLETELY may resolve findings, because
  resolving a branch the sweep never looked at is how a detector manufactures a
  clean board, which is the exact failure it exists to prevent. A degraded run
  is also not a counted run: recurrence and escalation stand still.

    - **prunable** — the worktree's directory is gone and only the

      it is an absent worktree, and an absent directory holds no uncommitted
      work. Skipped and counted.
    - **unreadable** — the status call failed for any other reason (permission,
      a stalled mount). That worktree's identity is QUARANTINED into ``held``
      so the reconciler leaves its finding exactly as it is. The class still
      reconciles everything it DID read: freezing all 161 worktrees because one
      was unreadable is a self-inflicted blind spot, and on this install the
      margin for that was a single worktree.

    Mtime caveat, stated because it decides a fail direction: git reports an
    untracked DIRECTORY as one entry (``?? dir/``), and a directory's mtime
    does not move when a file inside it is edited. So active work inside a
    long-untracked tree can read as old — which FLAGS it. That is the safe
    direction for a detector; the unsafe one would be reading it as new and

    failure record carrying those would read as a sweep that looked and found
    nothing — the exact "confident stale zero" this subsystem exists to stop.
    ``degraded`` is populated so every surface asking "is this blind?" gets
    True, and ``computed_at`` is stamped because a run DID happen: without it
    ``_freshness`` reports "never run", which is a different and false claim.

    But ``coverage`` and ``frozen_classes`` are SCOPE claims, not measurements,
    and omitting them is not neutral — which is this function's own generator
    biting it one review later. ``zero_drop_tools`` reads
    ``last_run.get("frozen_classes") or []``, so an omission renders as ``[]``:
    a positive, checkable assertion that NOTHING is frozen, published at the
    precise moment everything is. That is the mirror of the claim
    ``_maintain_blind_alert`` was just fixed to stop making, and the same
    sentence applies — a checkable runtime claim that contradicts the code is
    worse than a vaguer one. After a failed sweep the true value is known
    exactly and for free: every class is frozen, so say so.

    Never raises. A failure inside the failure path would replace the original
