"""Detached repo-pulse worker (session-manager PR-4a) — the run loop.

Spawned by the SessionStart hook (fire-and-forget; zero impact on the
hook's 5s budget — one gh round-trip alone exceeds it). Enumerates PRs
merged since the GLOBAL cursor, reconciles prior proposals against the
current ledger, matches new PRs against OPEN ledger rows across ALL
sessions (exact marker tier + fuzzy Haiku tier), and records annotations.
The ONLY live-ledger write is the exact tier's marker-triggered absorb in
``live`` mode — an UPDATE through ``session_charters.ledger_update`` with
PR evidence, reversible via ``session_ledger_update``. Fuzzy results are
proposals in every mode.

Discipline (ledger_worker lineage):

- Own short-lived DB connections; the server's SerializedConnection is
  never touched. All failures are recorded, never raised — nothing is
  attached to read a detached process's exit status.
- Worker-owned GLOBAL cursor (``~/.genesis/repo_pulse/cursor.json``):
  ``last_merged_at`` advances ONLY after an ok run's rows commit
  (monotonic max under the flock), so failed/timeout/pre-migration runs
  self-heal by re-covering their window — the annotation unique index and
  the per-pair re-absorb guard absorb the re-coverage. ``last_run_ts``
  updates on every RECORDED outcome and drives the debounce.
- Global flock (``pulse.lock``): the loser records ``lock_busy`` and
  exits, cursor-safe. Debounce is checked under the lock; a debounced
  worker exits silently with NO run row (debounced rows would swamp the
  run-table denominator).

    """Open one pr_verifications row per merged PR (issue #1718 half B).

    The durable half of the post-merge E2E obligation: a merge-time
    declaration is advisory (#1824), so this row is what survives the merge.
    A DOCS-ONLY diff (every changed path passes ``is_doc_path``) is born
    CLOSED with the reason recorded — the owner's deterministic exemption, no
    model in the loop. Everything else is born OPEN for the validator.

    Fail directions, each deliberate:
    - changed-file list unreadable (API error, cap, malformed row, or EMPTY —
      a merged PR touches at least one file, so empty means the read lied,
      the exact empty-vs-unreadable ambiguity measured as a security HIGH on
      the hook's sibling reader) → the PR is NOT docs-only; its row opens.
      Cost: one validator look. The other direction silently forgives an
      unverified merge.
    - tables absent (pre-migration subprocess window) → nothing written and
      COMPLETE=FALSE, which makes the caller fail the run and KEEP the cursor.
      That third value is load-bearing and was missing in review: idempotency
      is not recovery. The unique index guarantees a retry cannot duplicate,
      but nothing retries a PR the shared cursor has already advanced past —
      so a silent no-op here would strand exactly the merges this lane exists
      to record. The window is real and structural on every existing install:
      the run-recording tables predate this one, so between a code deploy and
      the next server restart (when migrations run) ``_record_run`` succeeds
      while this lane cannot write.
    - ``exists`` pre-check before the files fetch: window re-coverage must
      not re-spend a GitHub API call per already-recorded PR. The INSERT OR
      IGNORE against the unique index remains the actual guard; the
      pre-check is an API-cost optimization only.

    Returns (opened, auto_closed, complete). ``complete`` is False when this
    run could not record every PR it was given — the caller then keeps the
    cursor so the next tick re-covers the window (every other lane's writes
    are dedup-guarded, so re-coverage is safe, and the ``exists`` pre-check
    makes it nearly free). The caller also wraps this in its own try/except:
    an exception must never break the absorb lanes or ``_record_run``.
