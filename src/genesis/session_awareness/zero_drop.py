"""Zero-drop classification — the pure core of the stranded-work detector.

Nothing here does I/O. The git and gh atoms hand this module their results and
it decides which conditions are STRANDED, which are covered, and which are
suppressed-but-counted. Keeping it pure is what makes the acceptance replay
possible: the two known-stranded corpus branches are classified by the same
function the live worker calls, from recorded inputs.

The classification problem, stated honestly (MEASURED on this install
2026-09-05, 1651 PRs / 209 refs): a squash-merging repo (``mergeCommitAllowed:
false``) never makes a merged branch tip an ancestor of ``origin/main``, so
EVERY merged branch reads permanently "ahead". A naive ahead-count query
returned 145 candidates of which only ~18 were real — ~12% precision. Four
name-free git signals were tried and all four failed, which is why a join on
PR history by head-ref NAME is here at all.

**The name join is evidence about the pipeline, never proof the work landed.**
That distinction is the whole design, and getting it wrong was this module's
first real defect: a cross-model review found that "a PR with this name merged
after your tip date" suppressed branches holding commits the PR never
contained. MEASURED 2026-09-06 across 217 refs — 5 branches carrying commits
that exist on no remote were suppressed, 4 of them by CLOSED PRs and 1 by an
OPEN one. A clean board that hides work is the exact failure this detector
exists to prevent, so verdicts are now ordered by EVIDENCE STRENGTH:

1. **SHA proof.** ``headRefOid == tip`` means the PR contained exactly this
   commit. MEASURED: 119 of 123 merged-covered branches match exactly.
   PR history is therefore indexed BOTH ways — by head-ref name and by head
   SHA — because a name-only lookup gates tier 1 behind tier 5: a branch
   renamed (or checked out locally under another name) matches no historical
   ``headRefName``, so the exact-SHA evidence never reached the classifier at
   all. MEASURED 2026-09-12 over 251 refs / 1775 PRs: 4 of 26 ``flagged_no_pr``
   rows (15%) were that blind spot, each one a local branch sitting at the
   exact head of a real PR — one open, two merged, one closed.
2. **Ancestry.** The tip is reachable from the PR's head, so everything local
   was in the PR. Costs one local ``merge-base`` and needs no clocks.
3. **Push state.** ``ls-remote`` gives the remote's tip SHA. If the local tip
   IS that SHA, nothing here exists only on this machine, whatever the PRs
   say. If it differs and the tip is not merely behind, local-only commits are
   PROVEN and no PR on that ref can cover them.
4. **Time guards** (``mergedAt``/``closedAt`` vs the tip date) — kept, but
   demoted to confirming a tip we already know is pushed. Head-ref names get
   reused (MEASURED: 35 of 1586 names, one carrying 7 PRs).
5. **The name join itself** — indexing only, and scoped to head refs in our
   own repository so a fork PR cannot cover a same-named local branch.

Where none of that settles it — the merged PR's head SHA is not in this
object store, so ancestry is unanswerable — the branch is FLAGGED with the
reason recorded and a one-command hint for resolving it by hand. Suppressing
on evidence we could not collect is the failure mode; an extra acknowledged
row is not.

Everything the run suppresses is reported as a stage count with its
denominator. There are no prefix denylists by owner decision: a backup or
scratch branch that flags is acknowledged with a reason (and because such a
branch never moves, the SHA-keyed ack never expires), which leaves a record of
the judgement instead of a rule nobody can see.

    redesigned around exactly that — and an identity carrying a control or
    invisible character cannot be stored as a key and emitted verbatim to a

    value the classifier had to refuse, and a refused worktree landed in neither
    ``present`` nor ``held``, so ``apply_sweep`` resolved a live finding about
    uncommitted work.

    That refusal is GONE — ``worktree_identity`` now derives an opaque key for
    any unsafe identity rather than dropping it (see ``OPAQUE_KEY_PREFIX``), so
    this digest is no longer what stands between a duplicated worktree and a

    net. Stated in the past tense on purpose — describing a quarantine that no
    longer exists is how the next reader trusts a guarantee nothing provides
    (cross-model review).

    The readable value is not lost — the finding row carries ``worktree_path``,
    and every surface renders THAT through ``neutralise``.

    The digest is FULL, never shortened. A key is the one thing that must not
    be truncated: two paths colliding on a prefix would silently transfer one
    worktree's acknowledgement to another worktree's work, which is the same

    `diverged` and PROVEN not, and **2 are ABSENT from the remote yet still
    PROVEN contained**. Deciding by push state alone would have flagged those
    two — so SHA evidence is not merely stronger here, it is the difference
    between 4 findings and 6, two of which would be wrong.

    The branch name when there is one — a worktree is USUALLY one-to-one with
    its branch, and the path can change while the work does not. A DETACHED
    worktree has no branch, so it keys on its path behind a prefix containing
    ':', which git forbids in a ref name, so the two spaces cannot collide.

    "Usually" is where this went wrong. ``git worktree add --force`` checks out
    a branch that is ALREADY checked out elsewhere, so two worktrees can carry
    the same branch and different uncommitted work — and they then collapse
    onto one ``(class, branch)`` key, where ``apply_sweep`` keeps the first
    sighting and the second can never be acknowledged or tracked separately
    (Codex P2, PR #1794). Such a worktree therefore takes a discriminator,
    behind the same ':' that makes the detached key collision-proof — a DIGEST
    of the path rather than the path, for the reason ``_path_digest`` states.

    The discriminator is CONDITIONAL, and that is load-bearing rather than
    tidy: the identity IS the ack key, so applying it unconditionally would
    change every existing worktree identity at once and silently expire every
    acknowledgement ever written. MEASURED 2026-09-12: 0 of 165 worktrees on
    this install share a branch, so the conditional form is a no-op here by
    construction and only starts acting when the ambiguity it answers actually
    exists.

    Being conditional has its own cost, which is smaller than the unconditional
    one but is not zero and is stated rather than left to be discovered: at the
    TRANSITION — a branch becoming duplicated, or stopping — the identity
    changes shape, so the old row is absent from ``present``, ``apply_sweep``
    resolves it and its acknowledgement goes with it. The work stays visible (a
    new row opens immediately), so the direction is safe, but that run publishes
    a ``resolved`` for a condition that did not end.

    ``branch_duplicated`` is stamped by ``list_worktrees`` over the FULL
    listing, not derived here from whatever subset a caller holds. That matters
    because the callers hold different subsets — the worker's HOLD path sees
    every registration including prunable ones, while ``classify_worktrees``
    sees only the ones it could read — and two populations would disagree about
    which branches are duplicated, producing a hold key that matches no finding.
    An identity computed one way in one place and another way in the other holds
    a key nothing matches, silently restoring the resolve-on-absence behaviour
    the hold exists to prevent.
