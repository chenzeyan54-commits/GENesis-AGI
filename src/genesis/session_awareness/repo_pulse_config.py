"""Repo-pulse control surface — live-read mode lever + knobs.

The ONE place the repo-pulse worker consults for policy (session-manager
PR-4a, ledger_shadow_config lineage):

- :func:`effective_mode` — ``off | propose_only | live``, re-read from the
  merged YAML (``config/repo_pulse.yaml`` + the user overlay
  ``~/.genesis/config/repo_pulse.local.yaml``) on EVERY call. No boot cache
  — each SessionStart-spawned worker is a fresh process anyway.

Unlike the ledger-shadow lever, ``live`` is the DEFAULT here: the fuzzy
tier is proposal-only BY CONSTRUCTION in every mode (the judge's matches
are stored as proposals, never ledger writes), so the lever only gates the
exact tier's marker-triggered auto-absorb — deterministic, evidence-carrying,
and reversible via ``session_ledger_update``. ``propose_only`` is the
de-escalation lever: exact marker hits are recorded as proposals instead of
absorbed. An INVALID mode degrades to ``propose_only`` — toward LESS write
authority, never silently off (a dead pulse would hide rot in the ledger).

Failure posture: a missing/corrupt config degrades to DEFAULTS. The
hook-level kill switch is separate and stdlib-cheap:
``GENESIS_REPO_PULSE_DISABLED=1`` stops the SessionStart hook from even
spawning the worker (the hook cannot read YAML — stdlib-only budget).

Dependency rule: stdlib + yaml + genesis.env + genesis._config_overlay
only; ``genesis.mcp.health.settings`` imports MODES from here, never the
reverse (one-way, the immunity rule).
