"""PR enumeration over the gh CLI (injectable runner).

Home of three listings: merged PRs (the repo-pulse cursor lane), open PRs (the
age-stale SessionStart surface), and — for the zero-drop detector's head-ref
history join — the full ``--state all`` listing. All three share the live slug
resolution, the timeout and the loud-cap discipline below. The import is
one-way (``zero_drop`` reads this module; nothing here knows about it).

Clone of the ``pr_review_harvest`` gh pattern with two pulse-specific
hardenings, both live-verified during PR-4 due diligence:

1. **The repo slug is resolved LIVE, never from config.** A configured slug
   can name a real-but-wrong repo and return PLAUSIBLE STALE data (the
   working-repo config entry answered with April's PRs — zero error, zero
   matches, permanently silent). ``gh repo view`` resolves from the git
   remote of the cwd, so the default runner pins ``cwd=repo_root()``.
2. **A capped window is loud, never silent.** GitHub search cannot sort by
   mergedAt ascending, so when ``len(prs) == limit`` the enumeration MAY
   have dropped older PRs inside the window — the result carries
   ``limit_hit=True`` and the worker records it on the run row. PR velocity
   here is ~100/week; the default limit (200) covers ~2 weeks of catch-up.

Nothing here writes anywhere; errors return ``{"error": ...}`` without
raising (the worker records them as failed runs and leaves the cursor).
