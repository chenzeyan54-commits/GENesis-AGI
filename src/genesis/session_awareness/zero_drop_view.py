"""The accounting view — one answer to "what fell through the cracks?".

The detector (``zero_drop_worker``) answers that question for GIT STATE. This
widens it past git without building a second store: every part below is
DERIVED, on demand, from a store that already owns the data. Nothing here
persists anything.

Why a view and not another table: the failure this whole subsystem exists to
prevent is a confident zero. Five partial surfaces each reporting their own
slice is how a gap survives — each one is correct and none of them is the
answer. So the parts are assembled together, and every count carries the
denominator that makes it checkable.

THREE RULES, each of which a surface here would otherwise get wrong:

1. **Every count carries its denominator.** ``open`` alone is not a
   measurement; ``open of tracked`` is. ``zero_drop.counts_by_status`` says the
   same thing in its own docstring — "the denominator every surface must
   render".

2. **A part that cannot be read says so, and does not take the view with it.**
   Each part is assembled inside its own guard, so a failing store degrades ONE
   part to ``{"status": "unavailable", ...}`` rather than blanking the board.
   The morning report's ground-truth section uses the same per-line shape for
   the same reason.

3. **A stale source is not a measured zero.** The detector's own reader
   contract (``zero_drop_worker.read_last_run``) is explicit that an empty
   result means "has not run", never "nothing is stranded". The PR cache is
   held to the same standard here: past its TTL it reports ``stale`` and NO
   count, because a dead worker's snapshot presented as a number is exactly the
   false-clean this subsystem exists to prevent.

COUNTS ONLY, deliberately. Item-level staleness is Beads' lane (owner ruling,
2026-09-07: the split is by AXIS, not layer), and the carve-out is also what
keeps untrusted repository text out of a surface that reaches Telegram — see
``build_view``'s note on the gaps part.
