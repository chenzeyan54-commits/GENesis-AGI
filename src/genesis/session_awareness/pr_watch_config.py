"""PR-watch control surface — live-read enable lever + knobs.

The ONE place the ``surface_pr_updates`` SessionStart hook consults for policy
(``repo_pulse_config`` lineage). Re-read from the merged YAML
(``config/pr_watch.yaml`` + the user overlay
``~/.genesis/config/pr_watch.local.yaml``) on EVERY call — NO boot cache, since
each SessionStart hook invocation is a fresh short-lived process.

The feature is a pure OUTPUT surface (it injects a nudge; it never acts on the
outside world), so a single ``enabled`` master switch is the whole policy — no
off/propose_only/live ladder like the write-capable levers. A missing/corrupt
config degrades to DEFAULTS. The hook-level kill switch is separate and
stdlib-cheap: ``GENESIS_PR_WATCH_DISABLED=1`` short-circuits the hook before it
imports anything (the hook keeps a stdlib-only budget and cannot read YAML).

Dependency rule: stdlib + yaml + genesis.env + genesis._config_overlay only;
``genesis.mcp.health.settings`` imports from here, never the reverse (one-way).
