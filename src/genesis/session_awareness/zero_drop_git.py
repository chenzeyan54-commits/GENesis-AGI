"""Git atoms for the zero-drop detector — one injectable subprocess seam.

Every call is READ-ONLY. The detector never fetches, pushes, checks out or
prunes: it observes the repository and writes only to its own findings store.
That is a requirement, not an implementation detail — a detector that mutates
the thing it measures cannot be trusted to report on it.

Read-only is enforced by CONSTRUCTION, not by choosing read-only verbs: every
argv is built by ``_git()``, which adds ``--no-optional-locks``. Without it
even ``git status`` writes — it refreshes the stat cache and takes
``index.lock`` — so the claim above was false for the busiest call in the
sweep until it was measured. See that helper for the measurement.

All commands run through a single injectable ``Runner`` (the hermetic tests
drive real fixture repos through the default runner and a fake one through the
seam), and every command is addressed with ``git -C <path>`` rather than a
process cwd — the repo's cwd drifts, and a lost cd would silently point the
sweep at a different worktree.

Each function returns data or ``{"error": ...}``; nothing raises. A failed leg
must degrade the CLASS it feeds (the caller skips that class entirely), never
half-apply: a partial sweep that resolved the branches it never looked at
would manufacture a clean board.

Timeouts (the raw-subprocess-with-no-external-watchdog carve-out in the
timeout policy — a hung git here sits on the detector flock and starves every
later sweep until process death, with nothing attached to notice):

- ref sweep 60s — MEASURED 84ms over 209 refs on this install (2026-09-05),
  so ~700x headroom; the failure mode is a locked/corrupt object store.
- ls-remote 30s — one network round-trip, MEASURED 0.39s.
- per-worktree status 30s — local, but a worktree under a dead network mount
  would hang; 161 worktrees means one hang must not eat the whole sweep.

    An empty set does NOT fail neutrally, which is what makes this a
    correctness guard rather than tidiness. Each enumerator feeds a class that
    RECONCILES: whatever it does not return is treated as gone, so an empty
    result resolves every open and acknowledged finding in that class at once —
    silently, confidently, completely. That is the false clean board this
    subsystem exists to prevent, arriving through the one door that looks like
    success.

    But the first version of this guard could not tell the two rc=0 empties
    apart, and they mean opposite things (Codex P2, PR #1794):

    * **rc=0, and git printed NOTHING.** A true observation of an empty set. An
      unborn repository has no local refs; a newly created or fully cleared
      remote answers ``ls-remote`` with no heads at all. MEASURED 2026-09-13 on
      git 2.43: an empty bare repo gives ``ls-remote --heads`` rc=0 and stdout
      of EXACTLY zero bytes, and an unborn repo gives ``for-each-ref
      refs/heads`` the same — and ``--exit-code``, the OPTIONAL flag that turns
      no-match into rc=2, is what this code would have to pass for emptiness to
      be an error at all. Refusing these froze both branch classes forever on a
      condition that never changes, and in the cleared-remote case every local
      branch is precisely the unpushed work the detector exists to report.
    * **rc=0, git printed SOMETHING, and none of it parsed.** The format changed
      under us, or the read was truncated. Nothing here can be trusted and the
      class freezes.

    So the discriminator is the RAW output, not the record count. Passing the
    parsed list alone is what made the two indistinguishable.

    Tested on the raw string rather than ``raw.strip()``, and the measurement
    above is why: an empty set is zero bytes, so WHITESPACE is not one — it is
    output that parsed to nothing, and it belongs on the freezing side. Using
    ``strip()`` would have quietly moved a whole class of unreadable output into
    the permissive branch, which is the direction that resolves findings.

    MEASURED 2026-09-06 before this existed at all: the guard was on ls-remote
    ONLY. ``for-each-ref`` and ``worktree list`` both returned a clean empty set
    from rc=0, and ``worktree list`` did so even for unparseable garbage.

    Where it actually fires, stated because the obvious reading is wrong: each
    enumerator counts unreadable lines itself and returns before reaching here,
    so for a non-empty output that parsed to nothing it is the caller's
    ``unparsed`` counter that freezes the class, not this. That makes this a
    BACKSTOP for a parser that ever stops counting — worth keeping, worth not
    mistaking for the primary guard.

    Routine catch-up merges are excluded, because a branch whose only local-only
    commits are merges of the base has diverged by ancestry while holding
    nothing unique, and flagging it would be noise on top of a real signal. A
    count of 0 means "diverged, but every distinct change is already on the
    remote", and the caller turns that into ``PUSH_BEHIND`` — i.e. SUPPRESSES
    the finding. That is why what counts as "unique" has to be exactly right.

    **A CONFLICT-RESOLVED merge is unique work, and excluding it UNDERCOUNTS.**
    An earlier version ran ``rev-list --count --no-merges`` and its docstring
    asserted that "merge commits carry no unique work". That is true of an
    auto-merge and FALSE of a resolution: the resolved tree exists in neither
    parent, so the change is real and lives only here (Codex P1, PR #1794).

    **Scoped honestly against the report's stronger claim.** Codex described the
    consequence as a SUPPRESSION — a branch whose only local-only commit is such
    a merge counts 0, is labelled ``PUSH_BEHIND``, and vanishes. That specific
    outcome could not be constructed: for the range to hold only a merge, BOTH
    its parents must already be on the remote, and merging an already-merged
    branch produces no conflict to resolve. Every range reachable here that
    contains a resolved merge also contains the merged-in commits, so the
    classification stays ``PUSH_DIVERGED``.
    What IS reachable, and what this fix is for, is the COUNT: ``local_only``
    is reported to a human as "commits that exist nowhere else", and it silently
    understated that number by one per resolved merge. A wrong number under a
    true classification is still a wrong number, and this subsystem's whole
    claim is that its counts can be checked.

    MEASURED on this repository when that was fixed: of 23 recent merge commits,
    **3 (13%) carry a non-empty combined diff** — content present in neither
    parent. Not a hypothetical, and more likely here than elsewhere because this
    repo cannot rebase (a history-rewriting publish is hard-blocked), so
    branches catch up by merging and every conflict resolved that way lands in a
    merge commit.

    The discriminator is git's own combined diff (``--cc``), which by
    construction shows only hunks differing from EVERY parent. Empty combined
    diff = the merge contributed nothing of its own; non-empty = it did.

    Untracked files count. An untracked source file IS stranded work — the

    its build/temp output, so the noise floor is low.

    **``--untracked-files=all`` is load-bearing, not a default made explicit.**
    Under git's default (``normal``) an untracked DIRECTORY collapses to a
    single ``?? dir/`` entry, so nothing about its contents reaches the caller.
    The dirty-state key is derived from these entries, and an ack is keyed to
    that state — so adding a whole new file inside an already-untracked
    directory left the key BYTE-IDENTICAL and the acknowledgement went on
    suppressing work it was never granted against (Codex P1, PR #1794).
    DEMONSTRATED: with two files under an untracked `somedir/`, default mode
    printed `?? somedir/` before and after editing a child AND adding a third
    file; `-uall` listed each child and gained the new one.
    It also makes the sentence above true — under the default, "an untracked
    source file" inside a new directory was exactly what could NOT be seen.

    counts either way (delta 0), because the build/temp output is gitignored. A
