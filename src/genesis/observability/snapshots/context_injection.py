"""Context-injection health: is a hook's output actually reaching the model?

The Claude Code harness persists a hook's stdout above an UNDOCUMENTED size
threshold: the full output goes to a file under the session's ``tool-results/``
directory and the model receives a ~2 KB preview. Nothing errors. The session
simply runs without whatever that hook was carrying — and nothing anywhere
says so.

MEASURED on this install (2026-08-30) by TWO different instruments, so the
denominators differ and are stated separately rather than blended into one
figure that belongs to neither:

  * counting FILES under the CC projects tree — 143 persisted hook outputs
    across 58 sessions, spanning a MONTH before anyone noticed;
  * scanning TRANSCRIPTS — across 387 transcripts, all 195 persistence
    wrappers found were SessionStart, every one the identity/charter/EK
    injection.

The
threshold also MOVES ACROSS VERSIONS (it dropped sharply in a CC update
mid-window, tripling the filing rate overnight; whether it can move without a
version bump is unverified), so no budget constant in any hook can be trusted
to stay correct indefinitely.

This collector therefore watches GROUND TRUTH — the harness's own persisted
files — rather than our arithmetic: a fresh ``hook-*-stdout.txt`` IS the
harness saying "I withheld a hook's output from the model", independent of
every assumption in every emitter. It never reads an emitter's constant, which
is what keeps it right when that constant is wrong.

Three things it deliberately does NOT do. It does not filter filings down to
the one hook we fixed — a filed proactive-memory or guard output is also a real
loss, with a different remedy, and reporting only what we recognise would
recreate the silence. It holds no state about emitters: the per-part markers
this used to read were deleted when the emitters gained a hard chokepoint,
because a marker could only ever record a condition that is now unreachable,
while the two conditions it never covered (the cap moving, another hook filing)
are exactly what this sees. And it never carries a byte of another hook's
CONTENT into its own observation — see :func:`_attribute`.

**Every read here reports its own failure.** A watcher for silent loss that can
itself go quiet is worthless, so directory traversal records unreadable paths
in :attr:`InjectionHealth.errors` rather than letting them vanish into an empty
listing. ``Path.glob`` was replaced for exactly this reason: it SWALLOWS the
traversal ``OSError`` and yields nothing, so an unreadable session subtree is
indistinguishable from a clean one.

Shape mirrors ``deploy_health.py``: sync filesystem work behind an async
entry, pure facts -> findings derivation, no side effects.

    producer is a genuinely different remedy. The numbers still reach the
    operator — `derive_findings` renders them in the alert body; they simply do
    not decide whether to re-page.

    An unattributed filing names its PATH: that is where the diagnostic value

    what the remedy asks the operator to open. ANY label naming no producer
    qualifies — an exact check against one of them told the operator to "read
    the path named above" for a filing whose path was never printed.

    The path is filesystem metadata Genesis observed, not file content — but
    the leaf ``hook-<id>-stdout.txt`` was named by the writing process, and
    POSIX permits every byte but ``/`` and NUL there, newlines included. That is
    far weaker than the 80-char content excerpt this replaced (one line, ~255
    bytes, no payload), yet ``memory/provenance.py`` now rests a first_party
    claim on this string, so it is escaped rather than trusted.

    It is escaped ONCE, by :meth:`InjectionHealth.note_filing`, which is why
    this interpolates ``d["path"]`` directly. This function used to escape it a
    SECOND time. That was not free defence in depth: with two layers, deleting
    either one left the whole suite green, so no test pinned either — the very
    shape the ingestion chokepoint exists to delete. Measured by mutation: with
    the second escape here, reverting ``note_filing``'s reddened 0 tests.
