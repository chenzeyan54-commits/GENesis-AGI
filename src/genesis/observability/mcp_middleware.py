class InstrumentationMiddleware(Middleware):
    """Records per-tool invocation metrics to ProviderActivityTracker.

    Provider names use the format "mcp.{server_name}.{tool_name}" to keep
    them distinct from LLM provider entries (e.g., "llm.gemini_flash").

    All tracking is fire-and-forget — tracker errors never propagate to
    the MCP tool handler.

    Per-call transaction boundary (WS-15 follow-up): when constructed with the
    server's long-lived ``db`` connection, each tool call commits only after a
    clean return and rolls back otherwise. This releases the read snapshot that a
    read-only tool would otherwise leave open in deferred-isolation mode — which
    pins the SQLite WAL checkpoint and makes later writes fail "database is locked".
    Writes already commit at the CRUD layer before the tool returns, so the commit
    here only closes a *trailing* read txn (it can never discard a tool's own
    write); any non-clean exit — a raised ``Exception``, or a ``BaseException`` no
    clause catches (``asyncio.CancelledError``, ``SystemExit``, …) — rolls back the
    possibly-partial write instead of committing it. The boundary swallows
    nothing: a ``BaseException`` is not caught at all, and the one ``except
    Exception`` clause always re-raises — sometimes as a ``ToolError`` chained to
    the original, when the argument diagnosis below can name a better cause. DB
    errors in this boundary never propagate to the tool handler.
