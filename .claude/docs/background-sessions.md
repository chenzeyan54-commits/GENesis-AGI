# Background Sessions — Decision Guide

Genesis can run background CC sessions via the `direct_session_run` MCP tool.
Read this guide any time you're considering a background session or sub-agent.

## Background Session vs Sub-agent

| Situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Task > 20 minutes | Background session |
| Needs browser automation with a persistent profile | Background session |
| Quick research returning results to this conversation | Sub-agent |
| Parallel analysis with no memory writes needed | Sub-agent |

**Default heuristic:** If you'd need to resume it later, or if results need to
outlive this conversation → background session. If you just need an answer in
the next few minutes → sub-agent.

> **Note:** the background lane owns a longer CC background-wait ceiling (set to its
> full `timeout_s`), so a dispatched `Workflow` inside a background session runs to
> completion instead of the CLI's default 600s truncation.
>
> **Origin delivery:** pass `deliver_to_origin=True` to `direct_session_run` (from a
> channel/foreground turn) and the session's terminal outcome — success *or* failure
> — is delivered back to the exact conversation it was dispatched from (the DM or
> forum topic). This is how you hand off long work from a channel and actually
> "report back." Without it, a successful background run is silent (only failures
> raise a Telegram alert); poll `direct_session_status` for the output. Delivery is
> framework-owned (the session need not — and for `observe`/`research` cannot — send
> its own report); oversized output is saved under `~/.genesis/output/` and delivered
> as a summary + file pointer.

## Dispatched from a channel? Long work MUST be a background session

When you are a foreground session driving a **Telegram/voice/OpenClaw reply**, your
turn **ends after you respond** — there is no live session left to report back when a
later-finishing task completes. A deep-research `Workflow` (or any 100+-agent fan-out)
run **inline** in such a turn is force-killed by the CLI's headless background-wait
ceiling (`CLAUDE_CODE_PRINT_BG_WAIT_CEILING_MS`, ~10 min) with only a partial result,
and nothing delivers it. This silently killed a real Telegram deep-research request on
2026-07-20.

So for a channel-dispatched request needing deep/multi-source research or any
background work likely to exceed a few minutes: **do NOT run it inline — dispatch it
via `direct_session_run` (`profile="research"`, `deliver_to_origin=true`) and reply
that it's running in the background.** The background lane owns a longer wait ceiling
(set to its full `timeout_s`), runs to completion, and — with `deliver_to_origin` —
delivers the finished outcome back to this exact conversation (the delivery model
merged in #1192). Terminal/interactive sessions may still run Workflows inline (you're
present to see them). The foreground system prompt (`conversation._BG_RESEARCH_ROUTING`)
nudges this automatically — but only for channels the delivery model can actually
report back to (**Telegram**, per `origin_delivery_supported`). On channels the
resolver can't address (WEB/OpenClaw, WhatsApp, VOICE) the result would fall back to
the owner surface, so the nudge is withheld rather than promise a report-back that
lands elsewhere.

## Profiles

| Profile | Browser | observation_write | outreach_send | follow_up_create | Web search |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `observe` | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ |
| `research` | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `interact` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `steward` | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

Most profiles block: Bash, Edit, task_submit, settings_update,
direct_session_run, module_call. Use `interact` for workflows that operate
external platforms (publishing, form filling) and need to communicate with the
user. Use `research` for investigation that writes observations/follow-ups;
it also reaches the `genesis-recon` tools, including read-only GitHub.com search and
source inspection of public repositories through a fixed unauthenticated API endpoint.
File reads are limited to 8 MiB. Its shared `web-research` skill and
research MCP configuration are required; dispatch fails clearly if either cannot
be loaded. Every other recon tool is derived from the live registry and denied.
Use `observe` for read-only investigation.

**MCP scoping is secure-by-default.** `CCInvocation.strict_mcp_config` defaults to
True, so every background session gets `--strict-mcp-config`: it loads ONLY the
servers in its generated `--mcp-config` (its `mcp_profile`) and never additively
inherits the operator's user-scoped `~/.claude.json` MCP servers (Claude Code's
`--mcp-config` is additive without strict — probe-verified). A profile that maps to
no genesis servers therefore runs with zero MCP tools (fail-closed), not the
operator's full set. Only human-driven foreground/interactive sessions
(`cc/conversation.py`, `cc/checkpoint.py`) opt out (`strict_mcp_config=False`) to
keep the full user-scoped toolset. As defense-in-depth, `_UNIVERSAL_DISALLOW` also
denies the user-scoped servers by name (`_USER_SCOPED_MCP_WILDCARDS`).

**`steward` is the one built-in Bash-enabled profile** — its Bash is restricted
to the `gh` CLI only, enforced by `scripts/bash_safety_hook.sh` via the
`GENESIS_BASH_ALLOWLIST` env var set from `CCInvocation.bash_allowlist`. It
still blocks Edit/Write/browser. Built for the upstream-PR stewardship
campaign: it reads/comments/reopens/closes Genesis's own PRs to external repos
and escalates code-change requests rather than editing or pushing itself. A
profile grants a scoped shell by appearing in `_PROFILE_BASH_ALLOWLIST`
(`src/genesis/cc/direct_session.py`); without an entry there, a Bash-granting
profile's shell is governed only by the global destructive-op blocks. The
allowlist matches the command's **first token** and blocks all
chaining/piping/substitution/redirection (`; && | $() ` ` > <`).

### Install-local profiles (overlay)

A deployment can register extra profiles — including Bash-scoped ones — without
editing the tracked `direct_session.py`, by adding an optional, gitignored
`genesis/cc/profile_overlay.py` exposing `register(ctx)`. The loader
(`_load_profile_overlays`) is a no-op when that module is absent (the default).
`ctx` is a `ProfileOverlayContext` that hands over the same building-block
disallow lists the built-ins use plus the venv-Python path, and an
`add_profile(name, *, disallow, addendum, bash_allowlist=(), mcp_profile=...,
skills=...)` method. `add_profile` refuses to redefine a built-in profile, so an
overlay can only add. This keeps install-specific session profiles (their names,
prompts, and tool scope) out of the shared repo while the generic mechanism
ships upstream. Note: allowlisting an interpreter (e.g. the venv Python) pins
only the command's first token — `python -c`/`python <file>` still pass — so an
interpreter-scoped overlay profile relies on its addendum for the
behavioural "only run module X" restriction, appropriate only for trusted
(Genesis-internal) sessions, not untrusted input.

## Memory Access Policy

Background sessions have strict memory isolation:

- **Vector store writes (Qdrant) are BLOCKED for ALL profiles.** No background
  session can call `memory_store`, `memory_synthesize`, or `memory_extract`.
  Episodic memory is exclusively for foreground user interactions.
- **Knowledge ingestion is BLOCKED for ALL profiles.** `knowledge_ingest`,
  `knowledge_ingest_batch`, and `knowledge_ingest_source` require explicit user
  authorization in an interactive session.
- **SQLite table writes are profile-gated.** `observation_write`,
  `reference_store`, `procedure_store` are available to research/interact but
  not observe. These write to structured tables, not vector stores.
- **Server-side code is unaffected.** Ego corrections, reflection output, and
  other server-side `MemoryStore.store()` calls bypass tool-level blocking
  because they don't go through MCP.
- **The session output IS the deliverable.** Background session findings belong
  in the final message (session transcript), not in vector stores. The
  foreground user reviews and decides what to persist.

## Key Parameters

- **`timeout_minutes`** — default 15, max 60. Use 60 for long research tasks.
  The clock runs the entire time, including during rate limit waits.
- **`model` / `effort`** — default Sonnet/High. Haiku for cheap bulk tasks.
- **`profile`** — see table above. Choose the minimum profile that covers the task.

## Preserve Partial Progress

The session's terminal output is the research deliverable. For work likely to
exceed one run, ask it to write a bounded artifact under its background-session
directory as it progresses; do not instruct it to use blocked vector-memory
tools. Structured observation/reference writes remain available when the task
specifically calls for those durable records.

## Rate Limits Are Shared

Background sessions share your account's Claude API rate limit with your
foreground session.

- Rate limit hits don't just block the background session — they block you too
- Rate limit wait time counts against `timeout_minutes` — 5 min waiting = 5 min less work
- Sessions that exhaust timeout during a wait fail with a Telegram failure notification
- Memory writes committed before failure are preserved

**Implication:** Don't run heavy background sessions during active foreground
work. Schedule long research sessions for idle periods.

## Failure Recovery

There is no resume path for failed background sessions. If a session fails:
1. Check the session output and any artifact path it reported.
2. Relaunch with the partial output or artifact path and ask it to continue.

Failure modes:
- **Timeout** → Telegram notification + any written artifact preserved
- **Rate limit during wait** → countdown expires → same as timeout
- **Crash** → Telegram notification, same recovery path
