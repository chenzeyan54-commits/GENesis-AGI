"""PostToolUse hook for ExitPlanMode — auto-bookmark plan sessions.

When a plan is approved (ExitPlanMode fires), this hook:
1. Writes a pending bookmark file for the MCP server to consume
2. Outputs the architecture review recommendation as additionalContext

The MCP server picks up the pending file on the next tool call and
creates the bookmark programmatically — no LLM dependency.

Reads hook input from stdin as JSON:
  {"tool_name": "ExitPlanMode", "tool_input": {...}, "tool_output": {...}}

Output format (CC PostToolUse hook contract):
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "..."
  }
}

    "(3-10 files, new components): run a focused CEO premise challenge + eng "
    "architecture review. For large plans (10+ files, new systems): run the "
    "full /autoplan pipeline (CEO \u2192 design \u2192 eng review). Always surface "

    # "STATE CONFIDENCE - explicit percentages for each part of the plan" used to
    # be step 2 here. It was a PLAN-level instruction delivered at PostToolUse,
    # i.e. after the plan had already been shown and approved - the wrong-moment
    # bug that scripts/hooks/plan_confidence_reminder.py exists to fix. That hook
    # now owns the ask, and it fires at the plan-mode boundaries instead: at
    # EnterPlanMode, where it still reaches the plan being written, and at
    # ExitPlanMode, where it reaches the revision and the next plan. Repeating it
    # here would be a second copy arriving strictly later than both. Step 2 below
    # is NOT the same thing and stays: reading the files you are about to edit is
    # implementation diligence, at a moment where it is still actionable.
    "2. DUE DILIGENCE — Read every file you plan to modify. Verify functions "
    "and classes exist as expected. Check git log for recent conflicts.\n"
    "3. CONFIRM PLAN VALIDITY — Verify plan is still valid against current "
    "code. If anything changed since planning, update the plan first.\n"
    "4. WORK THE PLAN IN ORDER — one step at a time, verifying each before the "
    "next; dispatch subagents for work that would bloat this context. The "
    "`superpowers` plugin's executing-plans / subagent-driven-development skills "
    "do this well where the install has it (optional; not present everywhere).\n\n"

    "- Run: ruff check <modified_files>\n"
    "- Run: pytest <relevant_test_file> -v\n"
    "- Commit: git commit with conventional prefix — uncommitted work is "
    "invisible work.\n"
