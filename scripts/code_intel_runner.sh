# code_intel_runner.sh — idle-gated consumer of code-intel index requests.
#
# Run every ~5 min by genesis-code-intel.timer. Triggers (post-commit hook,
# setup, the gitnexus surplus job, disk_reclaim) no longer spawn indexers; they
# drop a marker via scripts/lib/index_marker.py. THIS runner is the only thing
# that consumes a marker and invokes the locked+capped entrypoint — and only
# when the box is idle, so a reindex can never storm the container the way the
# per-commit fire-and-forget spawns did (host load 136, 70 D-state procs).
#
# Flow per pending marker:
#   idle gate (loadavg1 < 2, iowait < 10%, no CC session > 50% CPU; relaxed
#   after 24h so work is never starved forever) -> transactional claim -> run the
#   entrypoint FOREGROUND with CODE_INTEL_INDEX_LOCK_SKIP_RC=75 -> act on rc:
#     0  -> consume the in-flight row; stamp the full-success clock if applicable
#     75 -> lock held / host-frozen: restore the marker untouched (freeze-safe)
#     3  -> a requested tool was missing: restore, NO attempts penalty, loud log
#     *  -> failure: if this was an ESCALATED full (marker mode was fast), fall
#           back to fast + back off full (no attempts penalty); otherwise
#           restore with attempts+1 (moved to terminal failed state at the cap).
# The terminal action is persisted with the claim id before queue mutation. A
# later tick replays that exact action if the runner loses queue access or dies
# after the entrypoint returns, preventing a successful index from being run
# again or charged as a failure.
#
# Escalation: a fast marker whose graph has no recent full index runs as full
# (weekly refresh / first build), unless a recent full FAILED (backoff). cbm 0.9
# cannot resume a killed full, so the INITIAL from-scratch full rebuild is done
# SUPERVISED by an operator, not left to this loop (see the incident handoff).
