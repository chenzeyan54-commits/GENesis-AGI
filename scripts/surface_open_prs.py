"""SessionStart hook: surface age-stale OPEN PRs inline (session-manager PR-4c).

The repo-pulse worker fetches the open-PR set into a home-anchored cache each
non-debounced boundary; this hook reads that cache, computes staleness against a
FRESH ``now``, and surfaces the age-stale ones passively inline as one line:

    [Open PRs] 3 open PRs idle >=7d — #1379 (12d) · #1223 (12d, dependabot) ·
    #1406 (8d, draft). Ask "show PRs" to review.

Worker = fetch-only; this hook owns ALL display logic + the seen-map, so the
surface is always computed against the current clock (never a stale snapshot's).
Its stdout becomes context visible to Claude at session start (same contract as
scripts/surface_pr_updates.py). Fail-open: a missing cache, a stale cache, an
unparseable one, or disabled config -> print nothing and never block session
start. An UNEXPECTED error (in practice a genesis/src import skew) prints ONE
fixed-format line first, so a broken surface is not read as "no open PRs", then
returns. It still never blocks session start.
It NEVER prints CI/review state or "ready to merge" — a visibility nudge only.
