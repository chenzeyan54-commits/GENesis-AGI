"""Replay this install's real shell commands through a Bash guard and report the
rate at which it blocks them.

Deliberately NOT "the benign-block rate", which is what this line used to say.
The corpus is every command anyone typed here, DANGEROUS ONES INCLUDED, so
nothing in it has been classified as benign — which is why every rate this tool
prints is stamped UNCLASSIFIED. This docstring is also the CLI's --help text, so
the old wording was recreating the exact misreading the rest of the file exists
to prevent, on the most-read surface it has.

The dev skill's "Acceptance Bar + Measured Rate" asks a change to a Bash guard's
PREDICATE to carry a measured `blocked k/N` figure. That is a CONVENTION, not an
enforced gate — the PR template does not ask for it, no CI job checks it, and the
review-depth check is advisory by design. An earlier draft of this docstring called
it "Rule 5 of the hook contract"; there is no such rule at any ref, the phrase
appeared nowhere but here, and this repo's guard rules are lettered rather than
numbered. It was invented, and citing a gate that does not exist is worse than
citing none, so it is corrected rather than quietly dropped.

The number cannot come from CI in any case: the corpus is built from this install's
own session transcripts, which hold real commands (paths, hostnames, occasionally
secrets passed in argv), so it is never checked in and never leaves the box. That
also bounds what the figure can mean — see below. Before this existed the figure was
produced by a one-off sweep whose only surviving trace is a comment
(git_push_guard.py, the 11,488-command measurement) — the third such one-off, which
is why it is a script now.

    python3 scripts/replay_guard_corpus.py --list
    python3 scripts/replay_guard_corpus.py --guard protected_paths
    python3 scripts/replay_guard_corpus.py --all
    python3 scripts/replay_guard_corpus.py --rebuild --all

WHAT THE NUMBER DOES AND DOES NOT MEAN
--------------------------------------
It measures ONE side: how often a guard blocks a command drawn from ordinary work.
A rate measured on one side of a tradeoff is half a measurement, and a benign-block
rate of 0 reads IDENTICALLY for a correct guard and for an inert one. So this is
never sufficient on its own — every predicate change also ships a positive control
proving the dangerous form still blocks. This script deliberately refuses to print
a verdict, only a rate, so it cannot be mistaken for one.

It is also a REALISM check, not a coverage check: the corpus contains only shapes
someone actually typed here. A construct nobody has typed has no entry and cannot
show up as a false positive, so a clean sweep says nothing about it.

NO GUARD IS REPLAYABLE TODAY
----------------------------
Every entry in GUARDS is `not_replay_safe`, and `replay_safe()` no longer
exists. `--guard` and `--all` refuse with exit 2; what still works is `--list`,
the corpus build, and the citation check below.

The permission used to rest on a declared claim that a guard performs no writes,
no spawns and no network calls, re-derived by walking its imports. That claim
cannot be established by reading. The spelling set is open — aliases, lexical
scopes, decorators, `getattr`, shell redirections, dotted package imports — and
across four review rounds each fix surfaced the next round's miss, including
three fail-opens MEASURED inside the checks themselves: a `safe` boolean no
checker read, shell evidence unbound from the argv actually executed, and
`replay()` reading that boolean without verifying anything. Rather than patch a
fourth time, the walk is deleted and the permission with it. Issue #2036 brings
replay back the other way round — run it where the effects are IMPOSSIBLE, so
nothing has to be proved about the guard at all.

WHAT IS STILL CHECKED, AND WHY THAT PART SURVIVED
--------------------------------------------------
Most guards carry a ReplaySafety record whose prose cites the constructs it
stands on, as `Cite(module, symbol, fragment)`. `verify_declarations()` resolves
each module and symbol and asserts the fragment still occurs in that symbol's
source. For a PYTHON citation the source is tokenized and comments and
docstrings are stripped first, so a fragment cannot go on passing from inside a
comment after the code it described is deleted. For a non-Python citation only
full-line comments are removed — deciding whether a `#` starts a comment is
shell parsing, which this tool does not do — so that guarantee is Python's
alone. `--list` says which, along with the guard that carries no citations at
all.

That claim is CLOSED-SET: there is a finite right answer and the code computes
it. It is also the half that caught real rot — every one of the six line-number
citations in an earlier revision of this table went stale within five days, one
of them landing on a comment about an unrelated timeout — which is why symbol +
fragment replaced line numbers, and why this survived the deletion above.

The checker lives HERE rather than in the test suite, and that placement is the
point: four of the six findings on the first external review were the same
consequence of it living in a test, where "these declarations are checked" held
only while CI happened to run one module.

What this does NOT tell you is what any guard DOES. `--list` prints the limits
from one list (BLIND_SPOTS) so this prose and that output cannot disagree.

# review were the same consequence: "these declarations are checked" was true
# only while CI happened to run one test module, while this file, `--list` and
# the PR body all said it unconditionally. A developer who edited a guard and
# replayed before CI got no protection at all — which is exactly the moment a
# declaration is most likely to be stale.
#
# So `main()` runs `verify_declarations()` on both paths and REFUSES on failure.
# There is deliberately no --force, for the same reason the refusal default has
# none: an override on a measurement tool is a bypass.
