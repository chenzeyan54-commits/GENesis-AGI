"""Deterministic per-file review-coverage manifest.

Genesis's ``/review`` dispatches specialist reviewers by aggregate scope
signals, but each specialist independently runs ``git diff`` and self-selects
hunks — nothing enumerates the changed files or guarantees each is covered, so
on a large changeset a file can go unreviewed by all of them. This module emits
a deterministic manifest of the branch changeset (merge-base..working-tree) that
``review_enforcement_prompt.py`` injects into the review reminder, naming every
code file that MUST be covered. It is model-independent and strictly additive:
never blocks, never gates — an annotation on top of the existing reminder.

Design (self-contained ON PURPOSE):
  * NO ``import genesis`` — the enforcement hooks run on the MAIN repo's venv
    even from a worktree (editable install → main's ``src``), and the gstack
    skill lives in ``~/.claude`` (absent on most installs). The only repo reuse
    is the sibling ``_is_docs_or_config`` (github-aware), imported the same way
    the other enforcement hooks import their siblings.
  * ``scope_tag`` is ONE category per file, FIRST-MATCH-WINS, in the exact case
    order of ``~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-diff-scope`` (the source of
    truth — kept in sync by ``test_review_scope.py``'s conformance test). A
    multi-tag port would over-set the aggregate specialist gating (e.g.
    ``auth_controller.py`` must resolve to API only, never AUTH).
  * ``category`` (code/test/fixture/docs-config) is a SEPARATE axis from
    ``scope_tag``; the MUST-cover list is the ``code`` files, decided by the
    github-aware ``_is_docs_or_config`` so ``.github/`` workflows stay in-scope.
  * ``diff_lines`` is the UNFILTERED whole-diff line sum (matches the skill's
    ``<50`` specialist-skip gate).
  * Everything fail-opens to ``None`` — ``timeout=10`` on every git call (it
    runs on every user prompt), and any git error yields ``None`` so the hook
    prints its base reminder unchanged.

# /review-level audit) from a small inline one. It reads the STAGED index
# (``--cached``), NOT build_manifest's merge-base..working-tree basis: the review
# marker is keyed to the staged diff (review_state.get_current_diff_hash hashes
# ``git diff --cached``), so the classifier MUST share that basis or the mark-time
# level and the commit-time re-check could disagree on a byte-identical staged
# diff (level thrashing / spurious blocks). Fail-opens to "unknown" so a git error
# never fabricates a depth requirement — the CI review-depth check is the real
# backstop; this local layer is advisory anti-autopilot friction.

# ── review LANE — how much consequence a change carries ─────────────────────
#
# ORTHOGONAL to substantiality. Substantiality asks "is this big enough to need a
# deep review"; the lane asks "how much does it cost to be wrong". A one-line edit
# to an enforcement hook is `inline` and `critical` at once.
#
# ── the lane's OWN path vocabulary ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS DOES NOT REUSE `_scope_tag` / `_DOMAIN_SENSITIVE_TAGS`, which is the
# obvious economy and was the first two attempts at this lane.
#
# `_SCOPE_PATTERNS` is a Rails-flavoured taxonomy mirrored in from another
# codebase, and it answers a DIFFERENT question: "what kind of file is this, in
# Rails terms". The lane asks "how much does it cost to be wrong here". Building
# the second on the first produced SEVEN distinct defects, every finding this
# change has attracted from either reviewer or from its own author:
#
#   `auth` is 98% "session"      58 of 59 tagged files are CC-session machinery
#   `prompts` is 100% wrong      matches 10 scorers, misses all 84 prompt surfaces
#   `.txt` admits dependency pins  requirements.txt reached the light lane
#   `api` globs miss `api.py`    outreach/api.py defines Flask routes, tagged backend
#   `.markdown`/`.adoc` unreachable  listed, but `_category` calls them code first
#   extensionless stems unreachable  same cause, found a round later
#   `data_migrations` tags four ways  one directory, four different tags
#
# One class, seven faces: a vocabulary that does not describe this repo. Each fix
# patched one word of it, and the next round found the next word. So the lane now
# states its own consequence surfaces explicitly, for THIS repo, and the
# distribution is re-measured rather than assumed (see `classify_lane`).
#
# The narrow, DELIBERATE exception is test/fixture detection below, which stays on
# `_category`: that half keys on `_TEST_GLOBS`/`_TEST_DIRS`, which are ordinary
# naming conventions rather than domain vocabulary, and no finding has ever
# touched it.

#: Directory prefixes whose contents are consequence surfaces. Anchored at a path
#: boundary — a PREFIX, never a substring — so `src/genesis/db/migrations_notes/`
#: does not match `.../migrations/` by accident.
_LANE_CRITICAL_PREFIXES = (
    ".github/",  # can disable a required check
    "src/genesis/db/migrations/",  # schema
    "src/genesis/db/data_migrations/",  # data; MISSED by the inherited glob
    "src/genesis/dashboard/routes/",  # HTTP surface
    "scripts/ci/",  # implementations behind required checks — see below
)

# `.github/**` is critical because a change there can disable a required check.
# The IMPLEMENTATION behind that check disables it just as effectively, and until
# this was added only the YAML layer was protected: MEASURED, all 15 scripts
# `ci.yml` actually invokes — the leak scanner, the private-pattern scan, the
# migration-prefix check, the review-depth gate — took the standard threshold,
# so three unresolved P2s passed in a leak scanner where two would have blocked
# in the workflow that merely calls it. Covered by `scripts/ci/` above plus the
# `check_` basename prefix below; `test_required_check_implementations_are_critical`
# re-derives the invocation list from `ci.yml` so a required check added later
# fails that test until its path is covered here.


# THE LANE CONSULTS NO `_scope_tag` VALUE AT ALL, and the third attempt at this
# is the reason. The history is kept because each attempt looked correct:
#
#   1. Inherit `_DOMAIN_SENSITIVE_TAGS` wholesale -> seven defects, listed above.
#   2. Replace the taxonomy entirely -> silently NARROWED the lane, because the
#      `api` globs (`*controller*`, `*route*`, `*endpoint*`, `*/api/*`) reached
#      HTTP surfaces no explicit rule here named.
#   3. Re-admit `api` + `migrations`, the two the audit measured CLEAN -> BOTH
#      over- and under-classifies. `*route*` is a NAME pattern, so it dragged in
#      7 non-HTTP modules (`routing/router.py` is the LLM router;
#      `reflection/output_router.py` routes reflection output), while `*/api/*`
#      and `*/migrations/*` need a preceding path component, so a ROOT-level
#      `api/` or `migrations/` directory would read `standard`.
#
# The audit behind attempt 3 said `api` was "57 files, clean". That was a COUNT,
# checked by eye; it never asked whether those files were HTTP surfaces, which is
# the same error the `auth` tag was indicted for (98% matching on `*session*`).
#
# MEASURED before deleting, both directions, which is what attempt 3 lacked:
# dropping the tags leaves 58 of 58 route-defining modules in `critical` — zero
# misses, because the prefixes and basenames above already cover them — and
# removes all 7 over-classifications. This repo has no root-level `api/` or
# `migrations/` directory, so that half costs nothing either. The tags were pure
# cost by the time they were measured on both sides.
#
# So: a NAME pattern cannot answer "is this an HTTP surface". A path boundary can,
# and `test_every_route_defining_module_is_critical` /
# `test_no_non_HTTP_module_is_dragged_into_critical` hold both directions of that
# claim against the tracked population rather than against remembered examples.

#: Exact paths and basename shapes that are consequence surfaces wherever they sit.
#: `_blueprint.py` is here rather than in the prefixes because it is a route
#: registrar that lives beside ordinary dashboard code — see the enumeration test.

    it is deliberately dependency-free (see the module docstring) — and a second
    copy of that fence here would be the drift those mirrors exist to prevent.
    This mirrors what ``git_push_guard._classify_post_review_delta`` already does:
    settle the hook surface first, then ask this module.

    FAIL-CLOSED on an unknown scope. An empty *paths* means the caller could not
    read the change (a failed API call reaches us as ``[]``), and a change nobody
    can see is treated as consequential rather than waved through.

    MEASURED over the 40 most recently merged PRs (2026-09-13): critical 35.0%,
    standard 20.0%, light 45.0%. The bar, set before measuring, was that critical
    stay at or under 50% — a lane that calls everything critical decides nothing.

    THE DENOMINATOR MOVES, so re-running this will not reproduce the figure and a
    difference is not evidence of a regression. "The 40 most recently merged" is a
    sliding window: the same probe read 32.5 / 22.5 / 45.0 an hour earlier, and the
    2.5-point shift was entirely two PRs merging INTO the window (one of them
    hook-surface, hence critical) — the classifier returned an identical lane for
    every PR common to both runs. To compare classifiers, hold the PR set fixed and
    diff the per-PR ASSIGNMENTS; comparing two totals taken at different times
    measures the merge queue, not the code.

    Against THE VERSION THIS REPLACES — the committed tag-based classifier, which
    measures 30.0 / 60.0 / 10.0 over the same 40 PRs — TWO movements account for
    the difference, both derived per-PR rather than inferred from the totals:

    * **14 PRs moved standard -> light**, every one a PROMPT SURFACE (``SKILL.md``,
      ``.claude/commands/*.md``, ``src/genesis/skills/**``) — which ``_category``
      calls ``code`` and this vocabulary reads as prose. That is the intended
      reading; rule-docs belong in the widest budget. It is also mostly INERT
      rather than a loosening: 11 of the 14 contain nothing whose findings score
      at all, because every path in them is a ``git_push_guard._is_doc_path`` and
      that gate's ``doc_findings`` mode defaults to ``skip``. The 3 that do change
      behaviour are prose-plus-tests PRs whose TEST findings now clear at 3.0
      instead of 2.0.

      That inertness is a DEFAULT, not a structural bound. ``doc_findings`` is
      read from ``merge_gate`` in ``~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml``, so an install
      setting ``score`` gets the full 3.0 budget on prompt surfaces — including
      ``src/genesis/identity/`` and the executor/sentinel prompt directories. This
      repo's own rule for this shape says an exemption may cite a bound
      configuration CANNOT change, never a default; so the honest version is that
      the loosening is bounded on THIS install's settings, and that is the case to
      think about before widening the prose set further.
    * **1 PR moved standard -> critical** — #1874, which touches
      ``src/genesis/hosting/standalone.py``, the module serving ``/genesis/login``.
      That is the route-surface gap below arriving on a real merged PR rather than
      only on a constructed one.

    An intermediate, NEVER-COMMITTED draft additionally carried a blanket
    ``config/`` critical prefix and measured 32.5 / 57.5 / 10.0; dropping that
    prefix is what moved its one config PR back to standard. That figure is
    narrative about a draft, not a delta against this diff's base — recorded
    separately because stating it as "the previous measurement" is exactly the
    permanent-record error this docstring is otherwise careful about.

    A DISTRIBUTION IS NOT A COVERAGE PROOF, which is the lesson worth keeping:
    critical sat unchanged across that draft while it had silently stopped
    classifying ``*route*``/``*controller*``/``*endpoint*`` paths as critical.
    Same percentage, different membership; only a constructed test case found it.
    A LATER enumeration found four more the constructed cases also missed — route
    definitions in ``src/genesis/hosting/`` and ``dashboard/_blueprint.py``, one of
    them serving ``/genesis/login`` — which is why the lock for that class is an
    enumeration over every tracked module rather than another example. The
    always-fix floor still blocks a P1 or a CodeRabbit Critical/Major in every
    lane regardless of any of this.
