"""The escalation cap's remedy menu, as DATA, for the ask hook to substitute.

THE FOUNDING INCIDENT (2026-08-31). The escalation cap printed THREE remedies then; it
prints the four lettered below today, which #1971 landed on 2026-09-13. The count in
this paragraph is the count AT THE INCIDENT and does not drift with the gate. The relay
to the user DROPPED the first, INVENTED one the gate never named, and added "ship
as-is" -- the one outcome the cap exists to prevent. The gate said the right thing; the
session retelling it did not.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR. `scripts/hooks/ask_gate_menu.py` turns these labels and
descriptions into the options of an AskUserQuestion, so the user chooses from the
gate's own words instead of a paraphrase.

ONE DECLARATION, ONE CONSUMER, AND A REPLICA. The gate
(`scripts/review_enforcement_commit.py`) prints the same options from its OWN
hardcoded copy inside its block message -- it does not import this module, and that is
deliberate: importing it back would give a ~1,900-line security-critical script a new
dependency for no gain, while importing the GATE from the hook would drag `shell_parse`
and a `sys.path` mutation into the process on every question a session asks. So this is
a replica, and a replica is only as good as its lock. The lock in
`tests/test_hooks/test_gate_menu.py` drives the REAL gate and checks BOTH directions:
every label and description here appears in the gate's rendered message in this order,
AND the gate prints no option this file omits. The second direction is the one that
matters -- without it the gate could grow a fifth option (including, literally, "ship
as-is") and the substituted menu would silently drop it from what the user sees, which
is the founding incident by another door.

THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE VERBATIM EXCERPTS from the gate's message, not paraphrases. That
is what makes the lock exact rather than approximate, and it is also the product: the
user is supposed to read the GATE's words.

`scripts/lib/` already holds a stdlib-only Python module imported as a sibling
(`index_marker.py`; see `scripts/disk_reclaim.py` and `scripts/setup_claude_config.py`).
STDLIB-ONLY is a contract, not a coincidence: the hook that imports this runs on hosts
where the `genesis` package may not be importable at all.

ORDER IS A CONTRACT, not presentation. A session takes the menu in the order the gate
prints it, and a menu whose first entry preserves the change reads as "try harder" at
exactly the moment that is the wrong instruction. HAND IT BACK stays FIRST. Nothing may
normalise these to a dict or a set. (Peer contract, honoured from PR #1971.)

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. No `authorizes_commit`, no `resets_streak`, no
`required_action`. An earlier revision declared all three, for a commit gate that read
the user's answer back and honoured it. That gate is gone -- nothing reads an answer now
-- and a field with no consumer declares behaviour the system does not have.

SCOPE: the CAP tier only. Neither the round-2 mode-switch tier nor the final-round
terminal is here; `ask_gate_menu.py` explains why each is excluded and enforces both.
