"""SessionStart hook: inject Genesis context into CC sessions.

This script runs at CC session start (via .claude/settings.json SessionStart hook).
Its stdout becomes context visible to Claude in the session.

Each section is printed and flushed immediately so that if the hook times out
(e.g. DB query hangs), identity files (instant disk reads) are already captured.

Also writes session start timestamp to ~/.genesis/session_start for use by the
UserPromptSubmit urgent-alert hook (interactive sessions only).

For interactive (foreground) sessions: injects everything — identity files,
cognitive state, procedures, temporal context, capabilities.

For bridge-dispatched sessions (GENESIS_CC_SESSION=1): skips identity files
and cognitive state (already provided via --system-prompt), but still injects
procedures, temporal context, resume signals, and capabilities.

Skips ALL injection when:
- ~/.genesis/cc_context_enabled flag file is absent (eject lever)

# Claude Code persists a hook's stdout above a size threshold: the WHOLE output
# goes to a file and the model receives a ~2 KB preview. Everything below the
# preview is then invisible — not truncated visibly, GONE, with no marker in
# context saying so.
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-30 on this install (CC 2.1.246; ~25 probe sessions via the
# env-gated seam in main(), method in docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md):
#   * threshold = EXACTLY 10,000 CHARACTERS of hook stdout (10,000 inline,
#     10,001 filed; 6,000 two-byte chars = 12,044 BYTES arrived inline, so the
#     unit is characters, not bytes);
#   * the budget is PER HOOK ENTRY — two SessionStart hooks emitting 9,000
#     chars each both arrived inline, in print AND interactive mode. That
#     per-entry budget is why this script runs as FOUR settings.json entries
#     (--part charter | identity-core | identity-user | knowledge);
#   * the threshold MOVES ACROSS VERSIONS: on CC 2.1.218 it sat near the high
#     20 Ks (filings were rare, 28-32 KB); the 2.1.246 update dropped it to
#     10 K and the filing rate tripled the SAME DAY. Whether it can also change
#     WITHOUT a version bump (a remote flag) is UNVERIFIED — the product does
#     use remote gates, but no evidence ties one to this threshold. Either way
#     the constant below is a measured value for one pinned version, and the
#     ALARMS — the per-prompt scream, the awareness watcher over the harness's
#     own filings — carry the guarantee, never this number. The watcher never
#     reads this constant, which is what makes it right even when this is wrong.

    A test that drives the emission path must neutralise these, or it forks
    real background processes against the live repo. When each spawn was
    called directly from that path, neutralising them was a CONVENTION every
    such test had to remember for every spawn — and the second one broke it
    immediately: `test_context_injection_budget` patched the repo-pulse spawn
    (its comment even records why: "a side effect a budget test has no
    business having, and one that only shows up as flakiness under load") and
    then forked the zero-drop worker for real, which does a live `git
    ls-remote` and a 2000-PR `gh pr list`.

    Add new detached spawns HERE, never at the call site. That the emission
    path calls this and nothing else is locked by
    `test_session_context_zero_drop`, which asks the AST which `_spawn_*` names
    `_emit_body` calls rather than checking a hardcoded list — so a third spawn
    added at the call site fails that test without anyone updating it.

    Not a guarantee, and worth saying so precisely: this makes ONE thing to
    stub instead of N, for a test that drives the emission path IN-PROCESS. A
    test that invokes this hook as a SUBPROCESS is not covered by any stub —
    the durable answer there is a spawn-only kill switch, which does not exist
    (`GENESIS_*_DISABLED` is overloaded: the workers read the same variables to
    disable THEMSELVES, so arming them suite-wide breaks the worker tests —
    MEASURED, 42 of them). Today the exposure is nil: only one test file drives
