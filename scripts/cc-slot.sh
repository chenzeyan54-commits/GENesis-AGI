# cc-slot.sh — Persistent tmux slot for Claude Code sessions.
#
# THE one interactive launcher: every door (SSH slot hostnames, manual SSH,
# the dashboard web terminal via the bashrc claude() wrapper) converges here,
# on the same attach-or-create tmux sessions. Idempotent by construction — a
# door walked twice attaches the SAME claude instead of spawning a second one.
#
# Usage: cc-slot.sh <hostname>               SSH RemoteCommand; parses a
#                                            hostname like "genesis-3-4" to
#                                            slot 4 -> session "cc-4"
#        cc-slot.sh manual [claude-args...]  manual/dashboard door: prints the
#                                            slot map, takes the LOWEST free
#                                            slot, forwards extra args to
#                                            claude inside the session

# --- EPHEMERAL subcommands never get a slot ----------------------------------
# An ephemeral `claude <subcommand>` prints something and exits. A slot is wrong
# for it on three counts — it consumes a capacity slot the operator wanted for a
# session, it leaves a tmux session behind after the command exited, and the
# pane's scrollback is captured to disk when it does. `setup-token` prints a
# long-lived CREDENTIAL, so that last one is why this exists rather than being
# filed as tidiness.
#
# DEFENCE IN DEPTH, not the control. cc_exit_capture.sh already scrubs the pane
# tail through secret_scrub and WITHHOLDS it when the scrubber cannot run
# (MEASURED against four synthetic token shapes: all redacted, ordinary text
# unchanged). This keeps the credential out of the captured region entirely
# rather than relying on redaction to take it out afterwards.
#
# THE SPLIT IS BY LIFETIME, NOT BY "is it a subcommand". Being listed under
# `Commands:` in --help does not make something short-lived, and three of them
# are exactly what the slot exists for — losing them to a dropped SSH is the
# failure this launcher prevents:
#   gateway      "Run the enterprise auth/telemetry gateway"  — a daemon
#   agents       the interactive agent view; its own --help says --json is the
#                variant that "does not require a TTY", so the default does
#   ultrareview  a cloud multi-agent review over the current branch — minutes
# Those KEEP the slot. _CC_KEEPS_A_SLOT records that as a decision rather than
# an omission, so the drift test can demand every new subcommand be classified
# into one list or the other instead of defaulting into the bypass.
#
# Matched against $1 ONLY. Deciding it from anywhere else means modelling which
# global options consume a value, and this repo has paid for hand-rolled argv
# parsing before. Stated honestly, because the miss is wider than one example:
# MEASURED on 2.1.246, a global option BEFORE the subcommand still routes to it
# in 3 of 5 spellings tried (`--ax-screen-reader`, `--model opus`, `--settings {}`
# route; `--debug` and `--add-dir /tmp` swallow it). So `claude --model opus
# setup-token` is NOT recognised here and still takes a slot. That is an accepted
# limit rather than a hole: the capture is scrubbed either way, and the failure
# direction is the safe one — a missed bypass costs a slot, while a FALSE bypass
# would drop an interactive session on SSH disconnect.

# Resolve a USABLE temp directory into an exported TMPDIR, or leave both names
# genuinely unset. Returns 0 when a candidate was accepted, 1 when none was.
#
# ONE temp-dir policy, called from both the subcommand bypass below and the slot
# launch further down. It used to be two: the bypass tested `-d "$HOME/tmp"` and
# exported it, which accepts a root-owned directory left by an earlier sudo run
# and puts CC temp state somewhere this script never established is private.
#
# CREATING a directory does not make it USABLE: `mkdir -p` returns SUCCESS for
# one that already exists, including one owned by someone else. So each
# candidate must be created AND writable AND privatisable before it is
# accepted. `-w` alone passes on a group/world-writable directory owned by
# another user, where `chmod` then fails — swallowing that would leave session
# temp state readable by others, so a failed chmod REJECTS the candidate.
#
# ACCEPTED RESIDUAL: the tests come before the repair, so a directory we DO own
# whose mode already lacks u+w (reachable only under a pathological umask at
# creation time) is rejected rather than repaired. Deliberate — ordering the
# repair first would make the rejection path unreachable for any directory this
# user owns, which is exactly the path the security case needs to keep.

# ═══ Consent kill-and-recreate ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
# A slot can exist as a BARE SHELL (its claude exited, or it was born bare) and
# `new-session -A` below would silently attach to it, discarding the launch
# command — the operator lands at a prompt instead of claude, every time, which
# is the founding defect of the slot-door work. This block detects that state,
# DISCLOSES it, and — only on an explicit yes at a real terminal — kills the
# session BY ID so the untouched create path below rebuilds it properly.
#
# Placed ABOVE every latch and gate ON PURPOSE: `existing`, `_SESSION_EXISTS`,
# the capacity gate, the OAuth gate and the exec all take their first and only
# read AFTER this block — the staleness class that killed the predecessor design
# (7 review rounds) is retired by construction, not by re-checking.
#
# ONE deliberate exception, and it is bounded rather than hidden: the rebuild
# path asks the capacity engine about the post-kill RAM floor before it kills,
# because that gate can otherwise refuse AFTER the pane is gone. It sits ahead
# of the final state snapshot, never between it and the kill, so it cannot
# lengthen the interval the design is built to keep short. See "ADMIT BEFORE
# DESTROYING" below for why the RAM floor is the only check that qualifies.
#
# Manual/dashboard mode reaches here too but allocated a slot with NO existing
# session, so the has-session guard makes this a structural no-op there — only
# the hostname door (which targets a FIXED name) can meet an existing session.
#
# Safety rests on three MEASURED properties (tmux 3.4, scratch -L server):
#   1. Within one server, session ids are never reused ($1 killed, recreate ->
#      $2), and killing a stale id is a refused no-op that cannot touch a
#      same-named successor — kill-by-id is a compare-and-swap.
#   2. Across server GENERATIONS the id counter restarts at $0 — measured by
#      falsifying the naive design: a stale $0 on a fresh server killed an
#      innocent same-named session. The server-PID compare below is what makes
#      that impossible here, and it is load-bearing, not belt-and-braces.
#   3. One `list-panes -s` call is one round-trip to the single-threaded
#      server = one consistent state. The human wait sits BETWEEN two such
#      snapshots, never between a read and the kill.
# Set only when the consent rebuild actually destroyed a slot, and read by the
# capacity gate far below. A rebuild is NET-ZERO by construction — this slot was
# counted before and is counted again after — so the count gate has nothing to
# decide, and the RAM floor was already answered by the preflight.

# (signal-decoded) + a pane-scrollback tail to ~/.genesis/logs/cc_exit_<slot>.log.
# Without this a dying session (V8 abort, OOM kill, clean exit) leaves no trace —
# the 2026-08-19 death was undiagnosable for exactly that reason. `exit $__ec`
# reproduces claude's exit code as the pane's, so tmux sees the same dead-status
# and the `-A` attach-or-create behaviour (this runs only on CREATE) is unchanged.
# Captures when claude EXITS on its own (crash/OOM-of-claude/clean quit — the
# cases we care about); a SIGHUP to the pane itself (tmux kill-session / unit
# stop) may reap the wrapper before the trailer runs — the watchgod OOM sampler
# covers that subset. Capture is best-effort and never alters the exit code.
# `\$` defers expansion to the pane's shell; the `${...}` expand here in cc-slot.sh.
# The token-prep prefix `${_OAUTH_SRC}` goes BEFORE `cd` so the original
# `cd $ROOT && claude` guard stays intact: `_OAUTH_SRC` ends in `;`, so placing it
# after the `&&` (`cd $ROOT && <prefix>; claude`) would bind the `&&` to the prefix
# only and launch claude even when cd fails. The prefix is cwd-independent (absolute
# python path, home-anchored token file), and if the repo is gone that python is too
# → the read silently no-ops before cd fails. Do NOT move it after the `&&`
# (test_cd_guard_skips_claude_on_bad_cd).
#
# The two extra `-e` pins below are each a MEASURED gap, not a guess. `tmux
# new-session` builds a new session's env from the tmux SERVER's environment,
# updated by the client only for `update-environment` vars (SSH_*, DISPLAY, …).
# MEASURED on tmux 3.4, a new session on a server someone else started:
#   TMPDIR                 -> SERVER's value  (gap: pin it, or CC temp lands on
#                             the ambient/foreign dir, often /tmp this repo avoids)
#   GENESIS_CC_SLOT_OAUTH  -> SERVER's value  (gap: pin the RESOLVED lever so a
#                             hand-relaunch via the in-tmux bashrc wrapper honours
#                             the operator's always/off, not the default conditional)
#   PATH                   -> CLIENT's value  (NO gap: the door's PATH already
#                             propagates, so it is deliberately NOT pinned here.
#                             Do not "helpfully" add it — measured unnecessary.)
# CLAUDE_CODE_TMPDIR was already pinned for the same server-env reason.
# LANG stays LAST — a doors test parses the create line from its final -e.
#
# The temp pins are built as an ARRAY because they are conditional: when no
# usable temp dir was found above, pinning `TMPDIR=` would push an EMPTY value
# into the session, which is worse than not pinning it (CC would resolve an
# empty TMPDIR rather than fall back to the system default).

_TMPDIR_UNSET=""

    # OMITTING the pins is not the same as having no value. A new session takes
    # its environment from the tmux SERVER (the inheritance measured above), so
    # with no pin the pane silently gets whatever that server holds — including a
    # stale `~/.genesis/cc-tmp` that we just rejected as unusable. The only way
    # to actually leave CC on the system default is to unset both names INSIDE
    # the pane. Joined with `&&`, not `;`, so a failed `cd` still skips claude
    # (test_cd_guard_skips_claude_on_bad_cd); `unset` cannot fail, so it never
    # blocks the launch. With these two branches the pane's temp environment is
    # explicitly determined in BOTH directions — there is no third case.
    # (Referenced as ${_TMPDIR_UNSET:-} below: the launch line is extracted
    # and evaluated under `set -u` by the oauth tests, where a bare
    # ${_TMPDIR_UNSET} would be unbound.)
