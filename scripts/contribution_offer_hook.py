"""UserPromptSubmit hook that surfaces pending contribution offers.

Runs on every user prompt via .claude/settings.json. Hot path:

1. `Path.iterdir()` on ~/.genesis/pending-offers/ — sub-millisecond if empty.
2. If non-empty: read oldest marker (by mtime), inject a `[Contribution]`
   system-reminder to stdout, unlink the marker.
3. Exit 0. Fail-open on all errors.

Budget: 10s hook timeout configured in .claude/settings.json (CC hook timeouts
are in seconds). Real cost should be <5ms even when pending offers exist. No
network, no heavy I/O.

Stdlib only — no Genesis imports, no venv required. ``hook_output`` is a sibling
hook helper importing nothing but ``json``/``sys``/``typing``, so routing through
it keeps that contract; five other ``scripts/*.py`` hooks already import it the
same way.
