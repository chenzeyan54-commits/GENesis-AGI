#
# Records a Claude Code session's exit — the exit status (with a signal-decoded
# hint) plus a tail of the pane scrollback — to ~/.genesis/logs/cc_exit_<slot>.log.
#
# Why: a CC session runs as tmux `... exec claude` (see cc-slot.sh). When claude
# exits, the pane and its output vanish together, so a session that dies (a V8/
# Node fatal abort, a cgroup OOM kill, or just a clean exit) leaves NO durable
# trace — the 2026-08-19 session death was undiagnosable for exactly this reason
# (the kernel dmesg ring had cycled and the pane's dying words were already gone).
# cc-slot.sh drops the inner `exec` and calls this on claude's return so the exit
# is recorded before the pane closes.
#
# Best-effort by construction: it must NEVER fail the caller or change the
# session's exit code — the session is already on its way out.

set -u

# The captured pane tail can contain prompts, command output, or credentials, so
# keep the log owner-only. umask covers newly-created dir/file; the explicit
# chmod below also tightens a log that predates this hardening.
