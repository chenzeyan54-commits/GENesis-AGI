"""CI guard: an atomic write must not orphan its temp file on the exception path.

THE CLASS. The shape is "write to a temp, then rename it into place". When the
write or the rename raises and nothing unlinks the temp, the temp survives. That
is not theoretical: `~/.genesis/tmp9cis_fly.tmp` sat on the origin install for
3.5 months, 0 bytes, with `mkstemp`'s default naming signature. One file proves
both halves -- the leak happens, and nothing sweeps that directory
(`disk_hygiene.sh` roots every find at a named SUBdirectory; `tmp_watchgod.sh`
covers `~/.genesis/cc-tmp` and `/tmp`. Neither covers the `~/.genesis` root).

WHY A GUARD AND NOT JUST FIXES. MEASURED 2026-09-09 against the merge of this
tree (re-derived 2026-09-15): 63 atomic-write sites across 55 files, 30 of them dirty.
That denominator moved FOUR times, in both directions, and every move is worth
recording because each was invisible in a different way:
  * +1 site (58 -> 59). The temp-name test was anchored to the END of a string
    literal, so `f".{name}.restore-tmp-{getpid()}"` at guardian/cred_integrity.py
    produced NO ROW at all. The site was invisible rather than misjudged, which
    is why the error surfaced in the DENOMINATOR and in no verdict. It reads
    CLEANS_UP, so the dirty count was unaffected.
  * -1 site (59 -> 58, and dirty 31 -> 30). While this branch was open, main
    #1609 rewrote git_discard_guard._write_log_row to one file per flush,
    deleting the size-trim that renamed a temp into place. Its baseline row went
    stale and THIS GUARD FAILED CI until the row was dropped -- the shrink
    mechanism working on a fix it did not author. Note the counts must be
    re-derived against the MERGE, not the branch: a fix landing on main while a
    PR is open makes the PR's ledger stale, by design.
  * +2 sites (58 -> 60), found by an adversarial audit, both CLEANS_UP. Publish
    by HARDLINK -- `os.link(staging, final)` -- was not in the verb set, and in
    one of the two the marker lives in a MODULE CONSTANT, so
    `f"{stem}{_STAGING_SUFFIX}"` carries no ast.Constant piece for any suffix
    test to read. Both sites were absent, not misjudged. Note where the first
    one is: scripts/hooks/audit_jsonl.py, the file main added in the same window
    and the file that ABSORBED the row dropped above. MEASURED: with its two
    exception-path unlinks deleted, the guard reported `0 NEW` and exited 0.
  * +1 site (60 -> 61, dirty unchanged at 30). The zero-drop detector's own
    `zero_drop_worker._atomic_write_json`, CLEANS_UP. Recorded because it is the
    bullet above stated in the OTHER direction: that one is a fix landing on
    main while a PR is open, this one is a PR adding a site while main
    re-derives without it. Both make the ledger stale, and the second is the
    easier to miss — the PR's own CI is where it surfaces, so a session that
    pushes without reading `gh pr checks` will not see it. That is how this one
    was found: three pushes late.
  * +2 sites (61 -> 63, dirty unchanged at 30). This branch's own
    `worktree_lifecycle._compress_entry` and `._write_board_cache`, both
    CLEANS_UP, landing as main re-derived to 61 without them. That is the bullet
    above a second time, which is the point of recording it: the shape recurs
    every time a PR adding sites is open while main re-measures, and it is the
    merge -- not either parent -- that has to be measured. Found by the audit of
    that merge, not by the merge itself.
Fixing 30 instances of a recurring pattern leaves nothing to stop instance 31.
This is the prose-to-gate move: the rule was "clean up your temp", carried by
convention, and conventions are what reviewers find one instance of at a time.

WHAT THIS GUARD CLAIMS, PRECISELY: a temp created IN THIS SCOPE, written, and
renamed into place, where some reachable path out leaves it on disk. Three parts
of that sentence were narrower until a review round widened them, and each was
wrong in a way worth stating:

  * SCOPE, not function. Module level is a scope too. Skipping the born-here
    test there and stamping NO_HANDLER made a module-level move-aside produce a
    dirty row for a DURABLE operand while a module-level write that DOES clean up
    still read dirty.
  * WRITTEN, not just renamed. A handler wrapped around only the rename leaves
    the temp when the WRITE fails, which is the class this guard is named for.
    Creation is deliberately NOT the trigger -- if `mkstemp` itself fails there
    is nothing on disk -- and getting that backwards flags util/atomic.py, the
    reference implementation this guard tells people to adopt.
  * SOME REACHABLE PATH, not "no unlink anywhere". Crediting any syntactic
    unlink in the collected handlers let `except ValueError: unlink(tmp)` clear a
    rename that raises OSError. Requiring EVERY collected handler to unlink is
    wrong the other way, because handlers nest: an inner one that unlinks and
    re-raises means the outer never sees the temp. Handlers resolve innermost
    first, and a covering `finally` that unlinks dominates all of them.

The "created in this scope" half is load-bearing and was learned expensively. A first version
anchored on the verb alone, and `rename`/`replace` also covers move-aside,
claim-by-rename, rotate and quarantine -- shapes whose first operand is DURABLE.
That shipped a 49-row ledger at 67% precision, and because this guard PRINTS a
remediation, 16 of those rows were booby-trapped work items: following "unlink
the temp" would have deleted a live credential (guardian/cred_integrity.py), a
user's file (dashboard/routes/files.py), pending telemetry on its restore path
(observability/span_ingest.py), and a corrupt entry quarantined as evidence
(guardian/alert/queue.py). A false row in a debt ledger is worse than noise.

POLARITY IS ALLOWLIST. A site that is neither clean nor baselined FAILS. A new
atomic write added next year is caught by construction -- WITH ONE STATED
EXCEPTION. The baseline key excludes the line number on purpose (line numbers
churn on every unrelated edit above them), so a SECOND unprotected write added
inside an already-baselined function, with the same temp name, collides with the
existing row and passes silently. Verified: no duplicate dirty keys exist today,
so the ledger is currently honest. But "instance 31 cannot arrive silently" is
true only OUTSIDE the 30 functions already listed, and saying it unqualified was
an overclaim. The baseline below is a
DEBT LEDGER, not an exemption list: every entry is a known leak awaiting a fix,
it is expected to shrink, and the guard reports entries that no longer match so
a landed fix cannot leave a stale row behind.

WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT SEE, stated rather than discovered later:
  * Shell scripts. `guardian-gateway.sh` and friends need `trap 'rm -f "$tmp"'`
    and are not parsed here.
  * A cleanup performed by a helper this file calls (`self._cleanup()`), which
    reads as a leak. Baseline it with the reason; do not widen the detector to
    guess, because a detector that accepts an unexamined indirection accepts
    everything.
  * A temp named by a MULTI-ARGUMENT join -- `Path(tmpdir, "payload")`. A
    one-argument `Path(x)` is a transparent wrapper and is resolved to `x`; a
    join names a CHILD, and reducing it to its first argument used to record the
    DIRECTORY as the temp, which let a handler removing the directory read as
    cleaning up a child it never touched. Joins are now left intact, so such a
    site is UNMATCHED rather than wrongly cleared -- the safe direction, and a
    real blind spot rather than a fix.
  * A MODULE ALIAS. `import os as _os` then `_os.link(tmp, dst)` produces no
    row: the alias never reaches `owner == "os"`, so the link/move scoping
    excludes it, and for replace/rename the two-argument arity test drops it
    before operand resolution. MEASURED: zero `import os as` / `import shutil as`
    in the scanned tree today, so the published count is honest -- but this is a
    hole, not a design choice.
  * OTHER PUBLISH SHAPES: `Path.hardlink_to`, `shutil.copy2(tmp, final)`,
    `os.symlink`. These are UNHANDLED, not out of class. `final.hardlink_to(tmp)`
    is publish-by-hardlink with the temp as the ARGUMENT, so covering it needs a
    mirrored operand rule rather than the same one -- which is why it is excluded
    rather than added, and excluding it is a limitation to record, not a verdict
    about the shape. MEASURED across ten such verbs: zero live instances where
    the published operand is a born-here temp, so the count stands.
  * A CLEANUP IN ANOTHER SCOPE. `_born_in` stopped crossing scope boundaries
    (a binding in a nested def is a different variable) but `_unlinks` still
    walks freely, so an unlink inside a nested `def _rollback():` that nothing
    calls credits CLEANS_UP. Pre-existing, and the asymmetry is stated here
    rather than left for a reader to find.
  * A `nonlocal` temp created in a nested def and moved in the outer one. The
    own-scope rule drops it -- a recall loss taken deliberately, because the
    alternative reintroduces the cross-scope false positives it exists to stop.
  * A conditional finalizer. `finally: if enabled: tmp.unlink()` reads
    CLEANS_UP. Left alone on purpose: the overwhelmingly common form is
    `if tmp.exists()`, where crediting it is correct.
  * PYTHON UNDER A DOT-DIRECTORY, e.g. `.github/scripts/`. The scanned roots and
    the test that pins them both skip dot-directories. Zero such files today, so
    this is latent rather than live. `Path.rglob` also does not follow symlinked
    directories, so a symlinked subtree inside a scanned root is invisible and
    the completeness test cannot see it either.
  * Whether the destination directory is swept. A leaked temp under `/tmp` is
    collected by the OS; one under `~/.genesis` is not. The guard treats them
    alike -- prioritisation belongs to the human reading the report.

ITS OWN DEFECTS, KEPT BECAUSE THEY GENERALISE. Three earlier versions were wrong,
in different directions, and every one of them LOOKED right:
  1. Anchored on `mkstemp`, which missed every hand-rolled temp name
     (`f"{path}.{os.getpid()}.tmp"`) -- including two of the known leaks -- and
     accepted "a cleanup verb appears somewhere in the function", where `close`
     from `os.fdopen` is present in nearly all of them. It called 5 of 6 known
     leaks SAFE.
  2. Anchored on `replace`/`rename` by arity, which admitted 16
     `dataclasses.replace(record, field=...)` calls as filesystem writes, and
     read the DESTINATION as the temp for the `tmp.replace(dest)` form -- so it
     checked the wrong operand for cleanup.
  3. Anchored on the verb but not the operand's ORIGIN, admitting the durable-
     operand shapes above; and it excluded only the BARE `replace(x, ...)` while
     the `dataclasses.replace(rec, f=1)` attribute form -- the one this repo
     actually uses, 4 sites -- sailed through into the baseline.
  4. Anchored on the verb SET, which held only replace/rename/move. Publishing
     by hardlink was therefore invisible -- and so was any temp whose marker sits
     in a module constant rather than inline. Both were found by an adversarial
     audit, not by this guard, on live code added while the guard's own PR was
     open. The lesson is the one already stated above and re-learned anyway: an
     enumeration is only ever a census of the shapes the detector can see, so
     the count is the claim most likely to be wrong.
None was caught by running it. They were caught by SAMPLING the output, by
enumerating the shipped ledger rather than trusting its count, and by controls
that must flip. Tightening then LOST a real leak whose temp is bound two hops
away (`with NamedTemporaryFile(...) as tmp` -> `tmp_path = Path(tmp.name)`),
which is why `_born_in` is transitive: a precision fix measured without recall is
half a measurement. Hence `tests/test_scripts/test_check_atomic_writes.py`
pins known-clean AND known-leaking sites in both directions: a detector that
finds nothing is indistinguishable from one that looks at nothing.
