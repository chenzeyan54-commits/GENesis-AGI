# ─── Genesis tmux slots: ${TS_HOSTNAME} ───────────────────────
# Paste into ~/.ssh/config on your client devices.
# Usage: ssh ${TS_HOSTNAME}-1, ssh ${TS_HOSTNAME}-2, etc.
# Each slot maps to a persistent tmux session with claude.
# Or:    ssh ${TS_HOSTNAME}-lobby  → opens the session picker; pick any live slot.

# One-click "lobby": a FRESH picker over ALL live cc-* slots, every connection.
# After a client/reboot, ONE reconnect here brings the whole fleet back — the
# slots never died (they live in tmux on the box). It opens straight into the
# session picker (choose-tree): pick a slot and jump into it, in the state you
# left it; Ctrl-b s reopens the picker anytime.
#
# The picker itself is throwaway, named per connection and destroyed when you
# leave it. Anything you want to KEEP lives in its own session — a cc-* slot, or
# a scratch session of your own — which this door never touches and which shows
# up in the picker like everything else.
#
# This specific block MUST precede the wildcard below: ssh uses the FIRST
# matching RemoteCommand, and the wildcard would otherwise route
# "${TS_HOSTNAME}-lobby" into cc-slot.sh, which rejects the non-numeric slot.
# 'lobby' is not a cc-N name, so it never consumes a slot or the slot cap.
# The RemoteCommand sets PATH (an ssh RemoteCommand does NOT source .bashrc), so
# tmux resolves even where it is user-local — mirrors cc-slot.sh's toolchain PATH
# so the lobby door matches the numeric-slot door's behavior.
#
# The door is a SCRIPT (lobby-door.sh), not an inline tmux command chain, for
# the same reason the numeric slot door is one: an inline chain has to survive
# ssh_config -> remote shell -> tmux quoting, which is the documented failure
# mode of this block, and a script can be tested. A bare
# new-session-plus-choose-tree on a fixed name gets two things wrong: it
# inherits the previous visit's chooser, and a second window ends up stealing
# the first window's session. A per-connection picker cannot do either, because
# it is new every time and shared with nobody. Both failures are MEASURED and
# explained in full at the top of that script.
