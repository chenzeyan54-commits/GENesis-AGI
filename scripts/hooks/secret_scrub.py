"""Stdlib-only credential/secret scrubber for CC hooks.

Hooks that persist tool activity (session telemetry, audit trails) can
incidentally capture secrets — a ``cat secrets.env``, an ``export API_KEY=…``,
a token echoed in command output. Once such text lands in a per-session JSONL
or the DB it flows into memory extraction and proactive recall, i.e. it leaks
into places with a much longer life than the transcript. This module redacts
the high-confidence secret shapes BEFORE any such capture.

Design constraints:
- **Stdlib only, import-light.** Hooks run on a <50ms budget and must not
  import ``genesis`` (heavy) or touch the network. So the detection patterns
  are copied from ``src/genesis/memory/reference_extraction.py`` rather than
  imported. Keep the two in rough sync — this file favors RECALL (redact a
  little too eagerly) because a missed secret is worse than a redacted
  non-secret in low-stakes telemetry, whereas the extraction classifier favors
  precision (it fabricates references on false positives).
- **Fail-safe, never crash.** ``scrub`` returns a fully-withheld placeholder if
  its own regex work raises, never the raw input; ``is_secret_path`` /
  ``command_touches_secret`` return conservative booleans.
- **One secret-filename vocabulary.** ``is_secret_path`` is the single source of
  truth; ``command_touches_secret`` reuses it (tokenizes the command and asks
  ``is_secret_path`` per token) so the two can never drift apart.

Two layers callers combine:
1. ``is_secret_path`` / ``command_touches_secret`` — flag inputs whose *bodies*
   are secret by nature (``.env``, ``*.pem``, ``id_ed25519``, ``cat secrets``),
   so the caller can skip capturing the body entirely.
2. ``scrub`` — redact inline secret shapes from whatever text IS captured.

# ── Detection patterns ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# THREE files carry credential-detection patterns, and they are NOT all the
# same by design. Enumerated, with what each does on a match:
#   * this file                              — REDACTS captured telemetry
#   * ``src/genesis/security/output_scanner.py``  — FLAGS outbound content
#   * ``src/genesis/memory/reference_extraction.py`` — WRITES a stored reference
# The first two favour recall: over-matching costs a redaction or a flag. The
# third acts on a match by creating a record the user sees, so it favours
# precision and deliberately keeps a NARROWER class (its own comment explains
# the split). Duplicated rather than imported so this hook stays stdlib-only.
# Change a shape here, decide explicitly for the other two — do not paste.
#
# The STRUCTURED class is redaction-only and has no twin: it exists because a
# captured terminal stream carries credentials with no label and no vendor
# prefix, which is not a shape the capture-side classifier needs to recognise.

# Known key prefixes — format-only, near-certain real credentials. The whole
# match is the secret, so it is redacted wholesale.
# The character class after a prefix MUST admit ``-`` and ``_``: modern keys
# namespace themselves with interior separators (``sk-ant-…``, ``sk-or-v1-…``,
# ``sk-proj-…``), so an [A-Za-z0-9]-only class stops at the first hyphen — only
# a few characters in — and never reaches the length floor. The token then
# passes through whole. Prefixes are anchored on the left so a longer ALNUM run
# cannot part-match into one — but `-` is deliberately NOT excluded: a token on
# a git-diff line arrives as `-<token>`/`+<token>` with no separator, and pane
# tails routinely hold diff output. Excluding `-` regressed those to raw
# (measured against the shipping version). Over-matching after a hyphen costs a
# redaction, which is this file's cheap direction.

# Scanned LINE BY LINE against literal markers, not with one cross-line regex.
# The previous form anchored a non-greedy `[\s\S]*?` body on BOTH delimiters,
# which failed in both directions at once:
#
#   PERFORMANCE — every BEGIN with no END re-scanned the rest of the input.
#   MEASURED quadratic: 25.5s on a 256KB run of repeated headers, ratio 4.0 at
#   2x input. That is past the capture timeout, so the entire diagnostic was
#   discarded — the failure the timeout exists to bound, reached by ordinary
#   input rather than an attack.
#
#   CORRECTNESS — requiring both delimiters meant a HALF-VISIBLE key never
#   matched at all, and half-visible is the NORMAL case here: the capture
#   window (`-S -200`) and the 256KB input cap both cut at arbitrary positions.
#   A key whose BEGIN scrolled off, or whose END was cut, reached the log with
#   its body intact. Both directions were reproduced on the previous code.
#
# So a marker with no partner redacts the run of key-material lines ADJACENT to
# it and stops at the first ordinary line. Fail-closed on the key material,
# bounded in blast radius: one stray marker in prose (grep output, a docstring)
# cannot blank the surrounding diagnostic. Redaction is LINE-granular, so a

# tried here and BOTH were fail-opens dressed as perf fixes: a 253 cap on the

# nothing and stopped long usernames being redacted) and then a 32 cap on the
# SCHEME (which stopped redacting any credential URL whose scheme ran longer,
# a length RFC 3986 does not limit). Each bound was added to kill a quadratic
# scan, and each one silently traded a redaction for it.
#
# The scan is gone instead of bounded: the pattern no longer matches the scheme

# .env-style UPPER_SNAKE=value. The bare pattern over-redacts (PYTHONPATH=…,
# EDITOR=…), so it is gated to keys whose NAME signals a secret. A quoted value
# is captured whole (so a multi-word secret like KEY='a b c' is not left with
# its tail exposed after the first space) and redacted at ANY non-zero length —
# only an EMPTY quoted value is passed through, because the corpus measurement
# behind the value floor (16 newly-unmatched assignments over 779,899 tracked
# lines) found every one of them empty: the floor's whole measured precision
# gain lives at length zero, and a higher floor quietly stopped redacting the
# short quoted secrets the parent caught (`API_KEY="abc"`, a 4-digit PIN). An
# unquoted value keeps the 6+ floor: with no closing delimiter, a short bare
# word (`API_MODE=on`) is far likelier config than credential.
# LINEAR BY CONSTRUCTION, on every character class — a perf property measured
# on one input shape is not a perf property (the first fix here benchmarked an
# all-alphanumeric run, the exact class its anchor excluded, and was quadratic
# on underscore-bearing input; TestScrubIsLinearAcrossInputShapes now spans the
# classes). Three pieces:
#   * `(?<![A-Za-z0-9])` — a run of admitted characters offers only the starts
#     the lookbehind allows, not every offset;
#   * the BOUNDED repeats `_{0,4}` and `{2,512}` — plain syntax, deliberately
#     NOT possessive. The ceiling alone is what removes the quadratic: it caps
#     the work a failed `=` can spend re-scanning the key, so cost is O(N x 512)
#     rather than O(N^2). MEASURED whole-blob, ceilings kept, no possessives:
#     39KB/78KB/156KB = 349/705/1441ms — exactly linear; a realistic 200x200
#     pane tail is 80ms and the observer hook's 2000-char cap is 15ms, against
#     a 10s scrub timeout. Possessive quantifiers (`*+`, `{m,n}+`) would shave
#     the constant but are Python 3.11+ ONLY (bpo-433030), and this module is
#     imported by whatever bare `python3` the install has — so they made the
#     scrubber fail to import on an older system interpreter, withholding every
#     captured tail. They were removed for that reason and the removal is
#     MEASURED semantically free: 0 differing outputs over 20,270 strings.
#     Pinned by TestPatternsStayPortable;
#   * the 512 ceiling — bounds the per-start scan. The ceiling CANNOT reproduce
#     the old slide-forward fail-open for ordinary names (the lookbehind blocks
#     an alnum-preceded restart, so an over-ceiling key is a CLEAN MISS, not a
#     silently disabled hint). ONE residual, accepted and pinned by
#     TestEnvKeyCeilingResidual: a >512-char key with INTERIOR underscores can
#     match a late suffix without the hint — the lookbehind deliberately admits
#     a start after `_`, which is what keeps `2FA_TOKEN=` catchable. Longest
#     real key observed on an install: 31 chars.
#
# The lookbehind admits a LEADING underscore for recall (`_MY_SECRET=…`), and
# the empty-quoted exclusion is what removes the historical noise: an empty
# quoted value (`_OAUTH_SRC=""`) is not a secret.
#
# The bound it replaces was a FAIL-OPEN, and a subtle one: capping the key did
# not merely miss long names, it slid the match FORWARD past the name's prefix,
# so `_SECRET_KEY_HINT` no longer saw SECRET_/TOKEN_ and the value stopped being
# redacted at all. Bounding a repeat that feeds a downstream semantic check can
