"""Worktree ownership: record who holds a worktree, as a fact rather than a guess.

Many Claude Code sessions share one repository and 200+ worktrees, and nothing
records which session is working in which. The reaper tries to infer it, and the
signal it infers from does not exist here.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR, precisely: a session can be working in a worktree while
every signal the reaper has says nobody is. This records the one fact that
settles it — which live process is using this worktree — in a form the reaper
already honours.

THE TWO SIGNALS IT REPLACES, both MEASURED DEAD rather than assumed:

  * ``/proc/*/cwd`` ownership. ``worktree_cwd_guard.py`` and
    ``worktree_lifecycle.py`` each scan for a process sitting inside the
    worktree. 2026-09-10: 0 of 200 worktrees had any process CWD inside them
    while 7 session processes were running. Sessions ``cd`` per command, so a
    session's process CWD never leaves the main checkout.
  * mtime staleness. ``_last_activity_time`` samples the worktree root and TWO
    directory levels, and modifying a file updates that file's mtime only, never
    its ancestors'. 2026-09-11, with a control that moves: a worktree backdated
    19 days reported 19.0d; editing ``src/genesis/memory/store.py`` left it at
    19.0d and still reapable; editing ``README.md`` (depth 1) correctly reported
    0.0d. git saw the deep edit (``M src/genesis/memory/store.py``); the walk did
    not. Nearly all source in this repo lives below the sampled depth, so this is
    the common case.

WHY A ``git worktree lock`` AND NOT A CLAIM FILE. Two enforcement points already
honour it with no code to add to either: the reaper classifies a locked worktree
as protected, and ``git worktree remove`` refuses one. MEASURED with the control
moving in both directions.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT RECORD. Dirtiness. The reaper can compute that
itself, at the instant it decides, and does. Recording it here would mean
sampling it in one process and acting on it in another, and everything that
followed from that arrangement in an earlier design — a return code so one step
could tell the next, a re-check because the value went stale, a reconciliation
with a third tool — was a seam that generated its own defects. **A lock records
what cannot be derived; everything derivable is derived at the point of use.**
Only the claiming session knows its own pid, so that is the only thing here.

THE REASON LEADS WITH A SENTENCE, AND THAT IS NOT COSMETIC. git echoes the lock
reason verbatim when it refuses a removal, so the reason is read by a human or an
agent at exactly the moment they are blocked. A bare JSON blob there explains
nothing. The machine-readable half follows and is parsed from the first ``{``.

A lock whose reason is NOT our namespaced JSON is FOREIGN — a human's
``git worktree lock --reason "do not touch"``, or another tool's. Never parsed
for meaning, never auto-released. Refusing to interpret someone else's lock is
the whole point of distinguishing them.

Stdlib only, and deliberately so: this is imported by a PreToolUse hook on the
latency path and read by a reaper that may run under the system interpreter when
the venv is absent. ``yaml`` is imported lazily and only for the config read,
which falls back to defaults when it is unavailable.

    ONE condition, deliberately. An earlier design also released a live
    session's claim once the worktree looked idle, to stop a long-running session
    pinning a worktree for its whole life. That was built on the mtime staleness
    signal, which is MEASURED unsound for any file deeper than two directory
    levels — so it would have released claims on worktrees being actively edited.

    session is correct: that session may well come back to it, and the only cost
    is a merged worktree not being reclaimed while its owner is still running.
