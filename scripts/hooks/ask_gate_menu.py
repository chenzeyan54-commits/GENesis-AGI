"""Put the escalation cap's own menu in front of the user, not the session's retelling.

THE PROBLEM. On 2026-08-31 the escalation cap printed THREE remedies -- it prints four
today, lettered (a)-(d), a change that landed 2026-09-13 in #1971, so do not "correct"
the count below against the current gate -- and the relay to the user dropped the first,
invented one the gate never named, and added "ship as-is", the one outcome the cap exists
to prevent. The gate had said the right thing; the agent relaying it had not.

WHAT THIS DOES. When the review-round counter says the cap tier is live, this appends
the gate's OWN question -- carrying the gate's own remedy labels, in the gate's own
order -- to whatever the session asks next. The agent never authors those options, so it
cannot drop, reword, negate or pad them. The matching problem that killed two earlier
attempts (a coverage rule over an OPEN SET of agent-chosen words) stops existing rather
than getting defended better.

WHY THE COUNTER AND NOT A STORED MARKER. An earlier design persisted a "gate demand"
marker that the gate wrote on every block: question, remedies, branch, session. Across
four reviewers that marker and its lifecycle drew roughly 25 findings -- write, read,
retire, validation, scoping -- against ~3 for the substitution itself, at comparable
line counts. The last was a P1: the gate recorded `session_id: None` on every block
(it read the field from `tool_input` when it is a top-level key), so the cross-worktree
routing the marker existed for was inoperative in production and its own tests could not
see it. The marker only ever answered ONE question -- which tier is live -- and the
round counter already answers it, branch-scoped, with no lifecycle to get wrong. So the
marker is gone rather than patched again.

CAP TIER ONLY -- and "which tier is live" is TWO counters checked IN ORDER, not one.
The gate tests `lifetime >= FINAL_ROUND_CAP` FIRST, so above that line the live block is
normally the final-round terminal, whose options are ACCEPT-and-merge / ABANDON --
neither of which is in this menu. An earlier revision of this hook keyed on the streak
alone and therefore showed the CAP menu at the terminal: the user would have been handed
a menu OMITTING the only option that ends the loop and carrying three the live tier does
not offer. That is the founding incident arriving through the mechanism built to prevent
it, and the gate's own comment calls that state reachable. Both counters are read here,
in the gate's order.

A KNOWN GAP, stated because an earlier draft of this paragraph said "FIRST and returns"
and that is FALSE. The terminal returns only when the commit is NOT already carrying
`# final-round-accept`; when it is, the gate sets its spend flag and FALLS THROUGH to
the cap (`review_enforcement_commit.py:1027-1029`). So at streak >= cap AND lifetime >=
terminal, with that sigil present, the CAP block is what the user sees while this hook
stays silent -- uncovered, and it is exactly the state the gate's own comment names as
needing both sigils. It is not fixed here and the fix is not a better predicate: the
deciding input is a sigil on a future Bash commit command, which a PreToolUse hook on
AskUserQuestion structurally cannot see. The fail direction is the safe one (no menu,
session relays by hand = the pre-change behaviour), and `tests/test_hooks/
test_gate_menu.py` pins the gap so nobody "fixes" it into showing the cap menu at the
BARE terminal, which is the wrong-tier bug above.

The round-2 mode-switch tier is excluded for a different and equally mechanical reason:
`# audit-ack` deliberately does NOT reset the streak (a still-narrow fix must still
reach the round-3 stop), so a menu keyed on `round == 2` would follow the session
through every later question while it keeps working. The cap tier self-clears because
`# escalation-ack` calls `reset_review_round`.

HONEST LIMIT on that self-clearing, because the claim was once stated too broadly: it
holds for (b) REDESIGN, (c) NARROW and (d) SHELVE, which the user acknowledges. It does
NOT hold for (a) HAND IT BACK -- the gate's own message forbids the ack there, so the
streak stays at the cap and this menu re-appends to every later ask on the branch. That
is accepted rather than overlooked: the alternative is the retirement machinery this
design deleted, and a menu still offering "hand it back" to a session in the middle of
handing it back is inert noise, not a wrong instruction. The kill switch clears it if it
gets in the way.

FAIL DIRECTION -- OPEN, on purpose, and against the house default. A hook that can
refuse a question could leave a session unable to ask the user ANYTHING, including how
to unwedge it: its failure would cost more than its miss. So any internal error exits 0
silently and this is deliberately NOT wrapped in ``run_guard``. Failing open is also
unusually cheap here, because nothing downstream authorises on this hook's output -- a
miss costs a menu, never a gate. Every degradation reached through Python (unreadable
counter, missing module, version skew, kill switch, git hanging past the hook's timeout)
lands on "no menu this time", which is precisely the pre-change behaviour.

ONE DEGRADATION IS NOT IN THAT SET, and the guards below are load-bearing because of it.
MEASURED in the CC 2.1.246 binary: an `updatedInput` that fails the tool's input schema
is not ignored -- it is converted to a `deny` naming this hook, i.e. the "a hook can
wedge asks" failure this module vows never to cause. It is unreachable today (the model's
own input is schema-validated before hooks run, and `_canonical_question`'s bounds and
uniqueness checks plus the `_MAX_QUESTIONS` pass-through close the rest), which is the
only reason "never a gate" is true at all. So those checks are not belt-and-braces
against a retry: relaxing one on the grounds that "a miss costs a menu" would be wrong by
a whole severity level.

MEASURED (CC 2.1.246, live in a real session) and DOCUMENTED (Claude Code hooks
reference):
  * ``updatedInput`` under ``hookSpecificOutput`` on PreToolUse rewrites a tool's
    arguments before it runs, and is documented as applying to ``AskUserQuestion``.
  * It works ONLY without a ``permissionDecision`` field. MEASURED: adding ``"allow"``
    breaks the call into "user did not answer" WITHOUT the user acting -- a false
    negative that nearly killed the design. The docs independently note that a ``deny``
    alongside ``updatedInput`` discards the rewrite. Two reasons, one rule: never emit
    that field here. A test pins its absence.
  * Exactly ONE PreToolUse invocation per call, so an unconditional append cannot
    compound.
  * ``AskUserQuestion`` caps a call at 4 questions, and a question's options at 2..4
    (read from the binary: ``options:Me(J7o()).min(2).max(4)``). Out of range is not a
    shorter menu -- CC rejects the WHOLE call, the person never sees it, and the model
    is steered not to retry. That is the "a hook can wedge asks" failure this must never
    cause, which is why an over-long call is passed through untouched.
The docs carry no version contract for ``updatedInput`` and do not enumerate contexts
where it degrades, so re-probe on a pin bump (``docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md``).

DELIBERATELY ABSENT: the transcript. It records a tool call AS THE AGENT EMITTED IT --
substitution is applied afterwards -- so a transcript-read "verification" of what the
user was shown reads exactly the untrusted values it is trying to check.

    incomplete -- it would show cap options for a block that is offering

    BOTH VALUES COME FROM ONE SNAPSHOT, and that is not a micro-optimisation. Two

    `get_review_counters` is branch-scoped by construction -- it reads (0, 0) when the
    stored state belongs to a different branch -- so a menu never follows you onto
    unrelated work.

    Every failure path returns False (no menu), including the one where the terminal
    cannot be read: if we cannot PROVE the terminal is clear, we say nothing rather than
