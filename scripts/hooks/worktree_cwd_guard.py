"""PreToolUse hook: worktree safety guard (removal protection + relocation block).

Three modes:
  1. Bash matcher (default) — intercepts `git worktree remove` commands.
  2. ExitWorktree matcher (--exit-worktree) — intercepts ExitWorktree tool
     with action "remove".
  3. EnterWorktree matcher (--enter-worktree) — hard-blocks the EnterWorktree
     tool, which would RELOCATE the session into a worktree and make the
     conversation unfindable via /resume (see _handle_enter_worktree).

Removal modes (1 + 2):
  - If another process has its CWD inside the target worktree → hard block
    with PID list (cross-session safety).
  - If the current session's CWD IS the target → hard block (self-brick
    prevention).
  - If no conflicts → still block. Worktrees are never removed directly.
    The lifecycle manager (scripts/worktree_lifecycle.py) handles cleanup
    via a trash bin with 7-day recovery.

Incident 1: 2026-05-27 — Session bricked after deleting its own worktree.
Incident 2: 2026-06-09 — Session B deleted worktree still used by Session A,
turning A into a zombie.
Incident 3: 2026-06-29 — EnterWorktree silently relocated a multi-day session
into the `morning-report-nextsteps` worktree; its transcript moved to a
separate Claude Code project slug, so /resume from the main repo no longer
listed it (11 such `wt-*` relocation stubs had accumulated).

Stdlib-only. Fail-open on parse errors.

# fixed for: `git -C <dir> worktree remove <target>` produced no target, so a
# command nothing could tokenize fell OPEN. Cross-model review, 2026-09-06.
# Modelling git's global-option grammar here instead — which options take a
# value — is the open-set claim this file refuses to make in a regex, so the
# assumption is DELETED rather than extended. Anchoring on the subcommand and

    Code project slug (``…<repo>--claude-worktrees-<name>/``), leaving only a
    ``wt-<id>.jsonl`` pointer stub behind in the original project dir. The
    conversation continues seamlessly on screen, but ``/resume`` launched from
    the original directory no longer lists it — the session is, in effect, lost.

    Worktree *isolation* never requires relocating the session, so block
    unconditionally and redirect to non-relocating alternatives. Always returns
    exit code 2 regardless of input (``name`` / ``path`` / empty).
