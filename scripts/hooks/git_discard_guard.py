"""PreToolUse hook (Bash): a RECOVERY net for git commands that overwrite the
working tree — it snapshots, it never blocks.

Origin: 2026-08-22 — a verify-RED experiment restored a temporarily-broken file
with ``git checkout <file>``, silently discarding the session's real uncommitted
edits (no confirmation, no reflog for unstaged changes).

DESIGN — recoverability, not classification (2026-08-24, after the review loop)
==============================================================================
The job of DECIDING "is this command destructive?" from its argv is an OPEN-set
parser problem (flags, ``=value``, single-letter abbreviations, backslash-newline
continuations, global value-flags): every review round surfaces the next
spelling, and a block is
inherently a completeness claim, so every gap is a silent-loss hole. For the
RECOVERABLE verbs (checkout/restore/switch/reset) that job is therefore NOT done
here — a snapshot makes classification unnecessary. It survives only as the
crude, dependency-free substring blocks in ``.claude/settings.json`` and
``scripts/bash_safety_hook.sh`` (``git reset --hard``), an honest best-effort
SPEED-BUMP, not a security boundary.

``git clean`` is the EXCEPTION and the primary place this hook still BLOCKS
(exit 2): ``git stash create`` cannot capture untracked files — exactly what
``clean`` deletes — so the snapshot net gives clean ZERO protection. The block is
a CLOSED SET on the SAFE side (allow only the exact dry-run forms; block the open
complement), which a false-ALLOW cannot penetrate — see ``_clean_violation``.
The ``# discard-override`` sigil is its escape.

A submodule-RECURSIVE checkout/restore/switch/reset/read-tree (``--recurse-submodules``
or a truthy ``-c submodule.recurse``) is the SECOND block, for the same reason: a
superproject ``git stash create`` does not capture submodule worktrees, so
recursing into them is unrecoverable and a superproject snapshot there is a FALSE
recovery promise. Same ``# discard-override`` escape — see
``_submodule_recurse_violation``. NOTE this is NOT the same guarantee as clean's
block: clean is closed on the SAFE side (a false-ALLOW is impossible); this block
is closed only on the BLOCK side and still leaks a false-recovery-promise on the
safe side for recursion enabled by PERSISTENT config (no CLI token — a documented,
subprocess-free residual), so the snapshot note is hedged for recurse-capable verbs.

The SECURITY property this hook provides is RECOVERABILITY. For every
tracked-work-overwriting verb — ``checkout`` / ``restore`` / ``switch`` /
``reset``, plus ``rm`` / ``mv`` and the plumbing ``checkout-index`` /
``read-tree`` (which delete or rewrite tracked files from the worktree) — it runs
``git stash create`` FIRST — capturing worktree + index without mutating
anything (no ref, no stash-list entry, no tree change) — and logs the snapshot
sha. If the command then overwrites work, recovery is
``git stash apply --index <sha>``. This needs to recognize only the VERB, never
the destructive flag, so it is immune to the spelling games that sink a block —
and a MISS (unresolvable cwd, non-repo, clean tree, tokenizer split) degrades to
the status quo (no snapshot), never to a false block and never to a false
guarantee. The verb-triggered snapshot even covers commands a substring block
misses (e.g. ``git reset \\<newline> --hard`` still tokenizes with the ``reset``
verb present), turning "silent unrecoverable loss" into "recoverable".

For the recoverable verbs this hook is advisory and NEVER exits non-zero: a bug
in the snapshot path must fail OPEN (let the command run). The ONLY non-zero
exit is the ``git clean`` block above, and it fails CLOSED: if the precise parse
raises on a command that mentions ``clean``, ``main`` blocks UNCONDITIONALLY and
asks the user to simplify (no bespoke coarse re-parse — that hand-rolled floor is
the exact trap that drew a review CRITICAL), so a parser bug can never silently
ALLOW a destructive clean — critically on the DIRECT ``settings.json`` wiring,
which has no shell floor behind it. The snapshot recovery note is
delivered to the model via ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` (stdout),
because Claude Code discards an exit-0 hook's stderr.

DOCUMENTED RESIDUALS (honest claim — the snapshot is a best-effort net):
  * ``git stash create`` excludes UNTRACKED files: a ``clean`` deletion or a
    checkout-from-tree onto an untracked path is not recovered here. (Full
    coverage — an "uncommitted reflog" that captures untracked state — is the
    tabled north-star follow-up.)
  * ``assume-unchanged`` / ``skip-worktree`` modifications and an UNMERGED
    (conflict) worktree are invisible to / error out of ``stash create``.
  * Submodule contents are not captured by a superproject ``stash create`` — so a
    submodule-RECURSIVE checkout/restore/switch/reset/read-tree requested ON THE
    COMMAND LINE (``--recurse-submodules`` / ``-c submodule.recurse=true``) is
    BLOCKED (not snapshotted; see ``_submodule_recurse_violation``) rather than given
    a false recovery promise. TWO residuals remain, both requiring a subprocess this
    argv-only block avoids: (a) recursion enabled by PERSISTENT config
    (``.git/config`` / global / ``GIT_CONFIG_*``, no CLI token) is not detected and
    still recurses+overwrites — NOT blocked; and (b) a NON-recursive verb touching a
    submodule path is only superproject-snapshotted. For both, the snapshot note is
    HEDGED (it states submodule worktrees are not captured) so the promise is honest.
  * cwd resolution is deliberately simple (payload cwd + a leading ``git -C``);
    a cd-chain / exotic repo selector may snapshot the wrong repo or none.
  * The snapshot is taken at the PreToolUse boundary, BEFORE the Bash payload
    runs, so an edit produced by an EARLIER segment of the same compound
    post-dates it.
  * Snapshot commits are unreferenced; ``git gc`` prunes them after the
    unreachable horizon (~2 weeks). Recovery is for "just happened".
  * In-project this hook is wired TWICE (the ``.claude/settings.json`` Bash
    matcher AND ``bash_safety_hook.sh``'s advisory invocation), so a recoverable
    verb may be snapshotted twice — up to two identical-cwd rows/notes. Harmless
    (idempotent ``stash create``); broader dedup is the all-hooks-review
    follow-up.
  * Git ALIASES (``git co`` for checkout, a user ``nuke`` alias for a clean) are
    invisible to argv — the guard sees the alias token, not its expansion, and
    degrades to the status quo (no snapshot; and an aliased clean is NOT blocked
    here — only its expanded form, if typed, is). No false promise, no false
    block; just uncovered.

# ── whole-tree rewind: a LOUD NOTE, deliberately NOT a block ──────────────────
# `git checkout <commit> -- .` is not "discard my edits" — the broad pathspec
# matches every tracked path, so it rewrites the WHOLE worktree to that commit
# and silently reverts anything merged since. MEASURED 2026-08-31: one such
# command reverted two already-merged PRs; the first was found by luck and the
# second only by a second, different check.
#
# WHY THIS IS A NOTE AND NOT A BLOCK, since every other guard here that fires is
# a block. The admission test for a block in this module is UNRECOVERABILITY —
# `clean` (stash cannot capture untracked files) and submodule-recursion (stash
# cannot capture submodule worktrees). A tree rewind fails that test: `checkout`
# is in _SNAPSHOT_VERBS, so `git stash create` runs first and the pre-command
# worktree is recoverable. MEASURED on the real hook: exit 0, snapshot taken,
# recovery sha in the note.
#
# So the thing that failed in 2026-08-31 was not recovery, it was NOTICING. The
# snapshot note fires identically for every checkout/restore/switch/reset — it is
# routine furniture, and it never said "you just rewound the tree". This makes
# the note SPECIFIC for this shape while leaving the exit code alone, which keeps
# the module's stated contract intact ("for the recoverable verbs this hook is
# advisory and NEVER exits non-zero") and costs no completeness claim: a spelling
# this misses degrades to the ordinary snapshot note, not to a hole.
#
# THE TRIPWIRE (owner decision 2026-09-06): a match writes `tree_rewind: true`
# onto the row for the repo that was rewound, so recurrence is COUNTABLE rather
# than argued. If a rewind reverts merged work again despite this note, that is
# the measured evidence to escalate to a block; without it the escalation would
# rest on the same n=1 the first attempt did.
#
# COUNT ATTEMPTS, NOT ROWS — and note they are ATTEMPTS: this is a PreToolUse
# hook, so a row precedes execution and a short-circuited or rejected command still
# writes one (MEASURED). The count is an UPPER BOUND on rewinds that happened.
#
# This hook is wired twice (the .claude/settings.json
# Bash matcher AND bash_safety_hook.sh's advisory invocation), so one rewind
# normally writes TWO identical-cwd rows. A naive `grep -c` therefore roughly
# doubles the count, which pushes in the wrong direction for a decision about
# whether to add a block. Count the BROAD ones — a directory-scoped checkout is
# recorded too (same verb class, worth seeing) and is not the incident:
#   cat "${GENESIS_DISCARD_SNAPSHOT_DIR:-$HOME/.genesis/git_discard_snapshots}"/*.jsonl \
#     | jq -r 'select(.tree_rewind and .broad) | .event' | sort -u | wc -l
# Dedup on `event`, not ts+cwd: whole-second timestamps collapse two
# different-source rewinds of one repo in the same second, and split one
# command counted by both wirings across a second boundary — measured wrong in
# both directions. `event` digests (source, cwd, command), so the two wirings
# agree and distinct in-payload events differ.
# The store is a DIRECTORY of one file per snapshot, not a single file. This recipe
# named `~/.genesis/git_discard_snapshots.jsonl` until adversarial review measured
# it: that path is the pre-existing legacy file which `_snapshot_dir` deliberately
# does NOT migrate, so the documented command returned 7 (all of them throwaway
# probe rows) while the store the guard actually writes returned 0. Nothing
# conflicted during the merge that moved the store, because the resolver and this
# comment sit in different places — and the count is the entire stated basis for
# escalating to a block. `// "unknown"` because `.cwd` can be JSON null, which makes
# a bare `+` error out rather than undercount.
# Also note the count is only meaningful for rows dated after this shipped —
# building it generated probe rows against throwaway repos under ~/tmp.
#
# `switch` is carried for symmetry with _SUBMODULE_RECURSE_VERBS. Precisely: GIT
# rejects this shape — VERIFIED on 2.43, `git switch <ref> -- .` exits "fatal:
# only one reference expected", because switch takes no pathspec — but the
# PREDICATE here still matches it, so the note is emitted for a command that will
# then fail. Cosmetic (the note is advisory and the command never runs), and
# listed so a future git that grows a pathspec is covered. Do not read this as
# "the predicate cannot fire on switch": it can.
# `reset` is DELIBERATELY absent, stated because every other inclusion here is
# justified and a reader cannot otherwise tell a decision from an oversight (it IS
# in `_SUBMODULE_RECURSE_VERBS`, which is a different question). The defect this
# note exists for is a revert that lands INSIDE the author's own diff and so reads
# as deliberate. `git reset --hard <commit>` moves HEAD, so the difference shows up
# as the branch pointer rather than as working-tree changes attributed to the
# author; and `git reset <commit> -- .` rewrites the INDEX only, leaving the
# worktree alone. Neither produces the invisible-in-review shape. Both are still
# snapshotted by the net — they are in `_SNAPSHOT_VERBS`.

    ``# discard-override``), else None. Pure argv — no subprocess, no repo
    state — so it cannot be starved by a slow probe. Literal-membership verb
    detection (``"clean" in argv``) NOT positional resolution: resolution
    depends on skipping git's OPEN set of value-taking global flags, so a
    pathological ``git checkout clean`` merely over-blocks (override escape) —
    the direction this boundary wants.

    A parse cut short by one of shell_parse's BOUNDS lands on the same fail-closed
    message as a parser crash, because it is the same situation: this guard cannot
    prove a clean-mentioning command safe. It matters that the parser says so rather
    than raising — a bound does not crash, it silently returns fewer segments, and
    reading that as "no clean here" is a silent allow of the one unrecoverable
    operation this guard blocks. MEASURED before this call was switched: a
    `git clean -fd` nested 9 deep went from refused to allowed.

    `untokenizable` is deliberately EXCLUDED. It predates the bounds and this guard
    already allowed those commands, so failing closed on it would be a new
    over-block rather than a restoration — MEASURED at 209 of 1,367 real
    clean-mentioning commands, against 0 for the bounds. Widening to it is a
    separate decision with its own evidence, not a rider on this one.

    BOTH bounds refuse here. An earlier revision honoured it and softened the length axis, on the
    written grounds that "`bash_safety_hook.sh` keeps the real coverage there: its
    `git clean` check greps RAW text per shell segment". THAT WAS FALSE, and measured
    so: the coarse fallback at bash_safety_hook.sh:220 runs only when `_handled == 0`,
    i.e. when python3 or this guard is ABSENT or this guard CRASHED. Exiting 0 — which
    is exactly what softening produced — sets `_handled=1` and SKIPS the fallback.
    MEASURED on `echo "<49,200 chars>" && git clean -fd`: guard rc=0, hook rc=0, so
    nothing anywhere blocked a real, executing `git clean -fd`.

    That is the sibling-layer trap in its purest form: a fail-open justified by a
    second layer that does not actually cover the case, asserted in a comment rather
    than checked. The rule this leaves behind: a guard whose only verdicts are BLOCK
    and ALLOW must fail closed on ANY blindness, because "ask" is not available to it
    and the alternative to blocking is permitting. The per-axis severity flag that
    made this mistake possible has since been DELETED outright — see BlindSpot.

    ``options`` holds only the tokens that belong to the VERB — everything after
    the resolved subcommand index. Scoping matters: git's own global ``-C <dir>``
    is spelled identically to ``switch``'s force-create ``-C``, so a check written
    against the whole argv read ``git -C <path> checkout <sha> -- .`` as a
    branch-creating command and stopped warning about it — a false NEGATIVE on the
    multi-repository shape this feature exists for. Caught by an existing test.

    ONE walk, consumed by both `_rewind_source` and `_rewrites_whole_tree`. They
    each had their own copy keyed on ``argv.index(verb)``, which is the replica
    drift `shell_parse.git_subcommand_index` was extracted to end — its own
    docstring says so. Three copies of git's option grammar in one file is three
    chances to disagree, and they did.

    The subcommand is RESOLVED, never matched by membership. ``verb in argv`` made
    any token equal to a verb name the verb, so ``git add checkout old .`` — three
    filenames — reported source ``old``, emitted the whole-tree warning and marked
    the snapshot row as a rewind. That last part is what made it worth fixing
    rather than tolerating: the row is the recurrence evidence that would justify
    escalating this note to a block, so a false positive there argues for a block
    on the strength of something that never happened.

    ``-`` is an OPERAND, not an option. ``git checkout - -- .`` is valid — ``-``
    means the previously-checked-out branch — and MEASURED on git 2.43 it replaces
    the named paths from that branch, i.e. exactly the reversion this note exists
    to make conspicuous. The old walk skipped every dash-prefixed token and so

    """The specific warning. Says what the command DOES, not merely that a
    snapshot exists — the generic note already said that on 2026-08-31 and the
    reversion still shipped.

    THE RECOVERY ADVICE WAS WRONG FOUR TIMES, and the fifth version was not chosen
    by judgement — it was measured. Each earlier revision picked a command chain that
    looked right and failed in a state nobody had constructed, so the fifth pass
    stopped picking: 320 enumerated states (intervening commit x unstaged x staged x
    tracked deletion x untracked file x what you did after the rewind x same-file
    overlap x pathspec scope), six candidate procedures, with a no-op and a
    copy-the-reference-back ORACLE as instrument controls, and the success predicate
    and decision rule written down before any result was read.

    Two populations, because the question is only well-posed in one of them. With
    HEAD unchanged since the snapshot (240 cells), success means the pre-rewind
    worktree, index and staged/unstaged split are all reproduced AND any work made
    after the rewind is recoverable:

        capture + `checkout HEAD -- .` + `stash apply --index`   240/240  (= ORACLE)
        `checkout HEAD -- .` + `stash apply --index`              80/240
        `stash apply --index`                                     56/240
        capture + `checkout --no-overlay <snap> -- .`              36/240
        every other single command                               <= 56/240

    The winner is three steps because the two halves of the damage come from
    different places and no single command can fetch both: the merged work that was
    reverted lives on the BRANCH, and your own uncommitted edits live in the
    SNAPSHOT. A stash commit's parent is HEAD-at-create, so replaying it onto a
    pristine HEAD reproduces the snapshot exactly — which is also why
    `stash apply` ALONE scores so badly: it replays a delta, and at snapshot time a
    file the rewind later reverted had no delta, so it comes back reverted while the
    command exits 0 and looks like it worked.

    In the second population — you COMMITTED after the rewind (80 cells) — the
    winner scores 0/80, correctly: HEAD now holds the reversion, so step 2 reinstates
    it. Only content is well-posed there (porcelain is measured against HEAD, which
    moved), and `checkout --no-overlay` gets 72/80. The note says both, because
    telling someone to run the three steps after they have committed would hand back
    the exact reversion they are trying to undo.

    The ORACLE control is what made this trustworthy, and it failed FOUR times first
    — each a flaw in the instrument, not the candidates: an oracle that did not
    capture, a scorer that dropped a modified path from both sides of its own
    comparison, an oracle whose .git swap deleted the capture object it had just
    made, and a porcelain comparison that demanded deleting a file the user created
    after the rewind while another property demanded preserving it. A sweep whose
    oracle scores below 100% proves nothing; the numbers above come from a run where
    it scored 240/240 and the no-op scored 42/240.

    TWO things here were wrong when first written, both caught by EXECUTING them
    rather than reading them, and both are the reason this docstring is long:

    1. It recommended ``git stash apply --index <sha>`` alone, then swung to
       ``git checkout <snap> -- .`` alone. BOTH single-command answers were wrong,
       and the reasoning for the swing contained two claims that do not survive
       re-measurement. RE-MEASURED on git 2.43 against a repo carrying every state
       that distinguishes the candidates — a staged change, an unstaged change, a
       tracked DELETION, and a dirty file outside the rewound pathspec:

       * ``git stash apply --index`` on a dirty tree exits 1 — but it leaves the
         file UNTOUCHED. **No conflict markers.** The earlier "writes conflict
         markers into the file you are rescuing" overstated it: this is a SAFE
         refusal, which is recoverable (try the fallback), not corruption, which
         is not. On a clean post-rewind tree it restores everything with the
         porcelain BYTE-IDENTICAL, including the staged/unstaged split.
       * ``git checkout <snap> -- .`` is the one that silently loses work. Path
         checkout is OVERLAY by default, so a path your work had DELETED is not
         removed again — the rewind's version survives and can be committed. It
         also writes the snapshot tree into index AND worktree, flattening the
         staged/unstaged split, and ``-- .`` reaches paths outside the rewound
         pathspec. "Restores it cleanly, byte-identical" was simply false.
       * ``--no-overlay`` fixes the deletion loss at zero cost and is robust where
         stash-apply refuses, but still flattens the split.

       That reasoning produced the third revision — complete-form-first with a
       stated fallback — and the sweep above refuted it too: `stash apply --index`
       scores 56/240, because "restores the staged/unstaged split exactly" is true
       only when it restores anything at all, and on the central shape it exits 0
       having left the reverted file reverted. Handing someone a single command that
       half-restores is the FALSE RECOVERY PROMISE this module treats as severe
       enough to justify its second hard block, and picking between two partial
       answers commits that error whichever one is picked. The answer was to stop
       picking and measure.
    2. It asserted the command "rewrites EVERY tracked path". The predicate is
       deliberately generous (any operand ending in ``/``), so it also fires on
       ``git checkout main -- tests/``, which does not. The wording now matches
       what argv actually proves.

    The repo is NAMED because a payload can rewind one repo while snapshotting
    several; an unqualified sha sends the reader to the wrong worktree.

    # the predicate cannot fix that, because the gap is WHEN the hook runs, not what

    hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext on STDOUT — the channel actually
    delivered on exit 0. (Via the bash_safety_hook.sh wiring this stdout is
    redirected to that script's stderr and dropped; the DIRECT settings.json
    hook wiring — which `exec`s python so stdout passes straight through —
    delivers the real one. Double-wiring means at most a harmless duplicate.)

    BOUNDED, because the advisory is what this guard exists to deliver. Claude Code
    persists a hook payload over ~10,000 chars and hands the model a preview
    instead, so an oversized advisory is not a shortened advisory — it is an ABSENT
    one, and silently so. MEASURED with the 40-char synthetic cwd the tests use:
    one rewind note is 1,319 chars, seven repositories serialise to 9,430 (under the
    10,000 cap) and EIGHT to 10,766 (over it) — and the crossing comes sooner with
    longer real paths. The first version of this paragraph said 1,329 and 10,846,
    taken from an earlier probe with a different cwd width; adversarial review
    re-derived them. The conclusion is unchanged, but a figure presented as MEASURED
    has to be the figure. A compound rewinding that many repos is the case the
    multi-repo note was added for, so the cap was reachable exactly where the
    feature matters.

    The bound DROPS WHOLE NOTES and says how many, rather than trimming the joined
    text. That is not a style preference: every note ends in a recovery command
    carrying a snapshot sha, and a mid-value cut would hand the reader a TRUNCATED
    SHA — a command that fails, or worse resolves to something else, presented as a
    recovery instruction. An explicitly omitted note sends the reader to the
    snapshot log; an amputated one sends them to a wrong object.

    ``print_json_bounded`` then runs as the envelope backstop for the case the
