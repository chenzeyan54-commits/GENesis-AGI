"""PreToolUse hook: BLOCK a full-suite / whole-directory local pytest run.

Running a whole test directory locally on this shared box (let alone ``tests/``)
duplicates CI's authoritative full run and starves the live Genesis services —
which repeatedly OOM-killed the run mid-suite. Targeted local testing is a
SPECIFIC file (or a ``-k``/``-m`` selector); CI runs the full suite on every push.

This hook BLOCKS (exit 2) a pytest segment that targets no specific ``.py`` file
and no ``-k``/``-m`` selector — i.e. bare ``pytest`` / ``pytest -v`` or a bare
directory like ``tests/`` or ``tests/test_scripts/``. Detection routes through
``shell_parse.analyze`` (quote-aware), so a ``|pytest`` inside a quoted argument
is not misread as a run.

Allowed:
  - pytest tests/foo/test_bar.py            (a specific file / nodeid)
  - pytest tests/foo -k test_bar            (a -k/-m selector narrows the run)
  - pytest tests/foo.py --basetemp /wt      (a path-valued flag's value is not a target)
  - pytest tests/ -q  # full-suite-ok       (explicit override)
Blocked:
  - pytest -v                               (no path at all)
  - python -m pytest tests/test_scripts/    (a whole directory)
  - pytest tests/foo.py tests/              (a file + a whole dir still runs the dir)

def _carried_pytest_args(seg: Segment) -> list[str] | None:
    """Args after a carried pytest executable inside an UNRESOLVED carrier, else None.

    The resolver models uv's option grammar to find the carried command, and that
    grammar is an OPEN set: a value-taking flag before `run` swallows `run`
    itself, so the carrier stays opaque and the segment resolves to `uv`.
    MEASURED: `uv --color always run pytest` was ALLOWED where `uv run pytest`
    blocks. Four such gaps were reported on this PR alone, which is the signature
    of enumerating someone else's CLI rather than a list that was merely short.

    So this does not extend the grammar. It identifies the first command token
    after the literal ``run`` and hands its following tokens to the SAME
    `_targets_specific_test` used on a resolved run. Scanning every later token
    is incorrect: ``uv --color always run echo pytest`` runs ``echo``, while
    ``pytest`` is only its argument.

    The scan starts AFTER the `run` literal, because a `pytest` token ahead of it
    is a package NAME, not an invocation. MEASURED on this PR's own tree: scanning
    the whole argv blocked 18 install/inspect commands — `uv pip install pytest`,
    `uv add pytest`, `poetry add pytest`, `pipenv install pytest`, `pdm remove
    pytest`, `uv pip show pytest` — with a message telling the user to target a
    specific file, advice that means nothing for an install. Requiring the literal
    keeps the whole fail-open set closed: `uv --color always run pytest` and
    `uv --cache-dir /tmp/c run pytest` both carry `run` AHEAD of the token, which
    is exactly why the closed question beats modelling the flag grammar. `uvx`
    takes the command directly and has no subcommand to require.

    Both walks skip a value-flag's VALUE, using the SAME list the resolver walks
    with. That is one grammar dependency back, taken deliberately, because the
    unlisted-flag direction of this list is the safe one: a missing entry costs an
    extra token read (an over-block, overridable), while the list's one dangerous
    direction — a BOOLEAN flag wrongly listed — is the failure `--isolated` already
    taught this module, and is guarded there. Without the skip, a package NAME
    passed to a flag was read as the command: MEASURED, `uv --color always run
    --with pytest ruff check .` (a ruff run) and `uv --color always run --with
    pytest pytest tests/foo.py` (a correctly TARGETED run) both blocked.

    SECOND KNOWN RESIDUAL, also safe direction, and it is the price of the
    confidence rule below: once the walk meets an option it cannot size, it stops
    claiming to know which bare word is the command and looks for a `pytest`
    token among the rest. So `uvx --allow-insecure-host h echo pytest` — which
    runs `echo` — is refused. That is the same over-read the docstring above
    rejects for the CONFIDENT case, accepted here only because confidence is
    gone: the alternative is committing to the flag's value and allowing the
    whole-suite run this function exists to stop. It costs a refusal
    `# full-suite-ok` clears.

    It is narrower than it first looks, and the narrowing was MEASURED rather
    than assumed — the first example written here was wrong and a test caught it.
    The option must be unknown to BOTH this list and the resolver's `uvx` wrapper
    spec. A flag only the resolver lacks (`--directory`) leaves the segment on
    the carrier, but THIS walk still sizes it, stays confident, and reads `echo`
    as the command exactly as before.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL, safe direction: the `run` walk skips only flags it knows, so a
    literal `run` reached as an unlisted flag's value still ends the walk —
    `uv pip install --target run pytest` over-blocks. It is an install into a
    directory named `run`, it is refused rather than allowed, and `# full-suite-ok`
    clears it. Closing it needs pip's grammar, which is the open set this function
    exists to avoid.

    Returns None when the segment is not a carrier, carries no `run` subcommand,
    or carries a command other than pytest — `uv pip install requests` must stay
    allowed.
