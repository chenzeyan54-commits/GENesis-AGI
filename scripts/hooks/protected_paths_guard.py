"""PreToolUse hook (Bash): block rm/rmdir OPERANDS that target protected data.

Complements destructive_command_guard.py (depth-based) with an explicit
blocklist of named paths containing irreplaceable data: session transcripts,
encrypted backups, Qdrant snapshots, browser profiles, and the production
database.

Operand-aware (2026-08 rewrite): the old check was `if path in cmd` — a raw
substring test that blocked any command MENTIONING a protected path alongside
any rm (`rm scratch.txt; cat ~/backups/notes`) and blocked deleting a file
INSIDE a protected dir, contradicting this docstring. Now the rm/rmdir
segments are parsed via shell_parse.analyze (the same quote-aware parser the
push gate uses — no second divergent tokenizer) and only real deletion
TARGETS block:

  * the protected dir itself (`rm -rf ~/genesis/data`)
  * an ancestor of it (`rm -rf ~/genesis` — removes data/ as a side effect)
  * a glob that could match the dir or an ancestor (`rm -rf ~/genesis/da*`)
  * ANY glob under the dir (`rm -rf ~/genesis/data/*`, `…/data/*.db` — wipes
    the contents while dodging "the dir itself")
  * a protected FILE (the production DB + its WAL/SHM sidecars — deleting the
    -wal of a live SQLite DB silently loses committed transactions)

A specific non-glob file inside (`rm ~/genesis/data/old.log`) and non-rm
mentions (`cat ~/backups/notes`) are ALLOWED.

Relative operands resolve against the payload's `cwd`. Limitation (documented,
not hidden): a `cd` INSIDE a compound command shifts the real cwd and is not
tracked here — same posture as shell_parse: this is an approval/friction
layer, not a sandbox. The old substring check missed that case too.

Fail modes — THE TWO BLIND SPOTS ARE NOT TREATED ALIKE, and stating them as one
was this docstring's own bug for a while:

  * A command shlex cannot tokenize (ANSI-C quoting) falls back to the legacy
    substring check. That is unchanged, pre-existing behaviour, and the word
    "conservative" applies only relative to the OLD guard being reinstated — it
    is strictly WEAKER than the parse it stands in for (see `_block`'s caller).
  * A command past one of `shell_parse`'s BOUNDS is REFUSED outright and never
    reaches that fallback, because the fallback is weakest exactly where the
    command is most destructive: it cannot see an ancestor of a protected
    directory, nor a glob over its contents. The bounds are a SECURITY limit,
    not a nicety — an unbounded parse of a deeply-nested command runs this guard
    past its registered 10s timeout, and a hook killed at its timeout does not
    block, it PERMITS.

`shell_parse.analyze_checked` reports which one fired; `bounds_induced` is the
only thing this module branches on. An unexpected crash fails CLOSED via
hook_input.run_guard (exit 2).
