"""PreToolUse ADVISORY: surface private-data leaks in an outgoing PUBLIC push.

NON-BLOCKING. When a ``git push`` targets the public repo (origin), this hook
scans the diff being pushed for this install's private data — install IPs,
personal emails, and local release-fingerprints — and, if it finds any, injects
a review prompt into the model's context (PreToolUse ``additionalContext``). It
NEVER blocks the push: the CI ``leak-detector`` job and the branch/force gates
in ``git_push_guard.py`` own hard enforcement. Its job is to make the author
LOOK at suspicious lines before code goes public — the exact step that, when
skipped manually, put real install IPs into public test fixtures.

Reuses the contribution sanitizer's cheap REGEX scanners (``parse_diff`` +
``_check_portability`` / ``_check_emails`` / ``_check_fingerprints``) — NOT the
full ``scan_diff``, whose detect-secrets floor is fail-CLOSED (a false "missing
binary" finding on every push, since the venv bin isn't on the hook's PATH) and
whose secret scanners spawn one subprocess per added line (latency / timeout
kill on large diffs).

Contract: emits ONLY ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` on stdout and
ALWAYS exits 0. It carries no ``permissionDecision``, so it composes cleanly
with git_push_guard's ask/allow/deny on the same Bash matcher (each hook runs as
a separate process; additionalContext is concatenated, order-independent). Any
error → silent exit 0. An advisory must NEVER block a push.

Stdlib + the contribution sanitizer only.
