"""PreToolUse advisory: a ``gh`` listing is ALREADY capped before you ask.

ADVISORY ONLY. Exit 0 always, never blocks, fails open. The enforcement points
for bad counts are the reader's own discipline (CLAUDE.md, "A truncated listing
is not absence") -- this hook exists because that rule sits on the READER end
and asks you to notice an under-read at exactly the moment its own closing
sentence says you will not, because an under-read is indistinguishable from a
clean result.

THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (measured 2026-09-14): a session ran
``gh pr list --limit 30``, got exactly 30 rows, and reported "the repo has 30
open PRs". The real number was 78. It had not chosen a small number -- ``gh pr
list`` DEFAULTS to ``--limit 30``, so the command was behaviourally identical to
passing no flag at all. That is the case with no cue in it: when you type a
limit you know you limited something, and when you do not, nothing in the
command tells you a cap is already in force.

So this fires on the UNFLAGGED listing, which is the half you cannot feel, and
stays silent when you passed a limit yourself.

WHY PRE- AND NOT POST-EXECUTION. A post-hoc detector would compare the returned
record count against the limit and fire on saturation. That was measured and
rejected: across 1,168 transcripts / 79,841 Bash calls, saturation
(``n >= limit``) occurred 877 times, but 814 of those (93%) were compound
commands whose stdout is the concatenation of several commands, where the record
count means nothing and the hook would have to stay silent anyway. The
defensible fire set was 63 -- about one per twenty sessions -- for a record
counter, a JSON-shape table, an output-attribution guard and per-query dedup.
The pre-flight form needs none of that, reads no output, and has no attribution
problem, because it is a statement about the COMMAND rather than about a result.

NAMED GAPS, so this is not read as covering more than it does:
  * An explicit ``--limit`` that actually narrows or widens the read is out of
    scope -- the write-side rule in CLAUDE.md covers the limit you chose. A limit
    equal to gh's own default IS in scope, because it changed nothing.
  * A gh ALIAS that expands to a listing (``gh prs`` for ``gh pr list``) is a
    miss: the alias name is one word, so no (group, sub) resolves.
  * ``| head``, ``head -N`` and ``grep -m N`` are out of scope. Measured: they
    are 30% of all Bash calls and saturate by construction, so including them
    was a 13x noise increase for a class that is a deliberate preview.
  * SQL ``LIMIT n`` is out of scope: counting its result is unreliable across
    clients, which is the noise risk, not a claim that the semantics differ.
  * A ``gh`` call inside ``python -c`` or another embedded string is invisible
    here -- the limit is not in argv.
  * A subcommand with no entry in the defaults table is silent, never guessed --
    and THE TABLE IS INCOMPLETE, which is the largest open gap here. MEASURED on
    gh 2.98.0: ``label list``, ``org list``, ``project list``, ``project
    item-list``, ``ruleset list`` and ``codespace list`` all advertise
    ``--limit int ... (default 30)`` and are absent from the table, so
    ``gh label list`` can produce exactly the false count this hook exists to
    prevent. Hand-listing the rest would be a second copy that drifts the same
    way the first did; the fix is to DERIVE the inventory from ``gh help
    reference`` so the drift test detects a newly capped command instead of only
    re-checking rows already present. Tracked as issue #2064 rather than done
    here, because it changes the drift test rather than the table.
  * A value-taking flag placed BEFORE the leaf subcommand is a miss.
    CONFIRMED against gh 2.98.0: ``gh pr --state open list`` runs, and resolves
    here to the target ``("pr", "open")``, which has no table entry, so the hook
    stays silent. Closing it needs a per-subcommand model of gh's option grammar
    -- the open-set surface the genesis-development skill names as a tar pit --
    and the failure direction is SILENCE, which is the status quo. Left open
    deliberately.
  * A limit inside a short-flag CLUSTER is a miss in the other direction.
    CONFIRMED: ``gh pr list -dL200`` runs and really fetches 200, but ``-dL200``
    is not read as a limit, so the hook advises about a cap that is not in force.
    Costs a line of noise on a spelling with no occurrence in the 177,949-command
    replay; same open-set reasoning.
  * ``--help`` or ``--web`` appearing as a flag VALUE silences a real listing.
    MEASURED: ``gh issue list --search '--web'`` goes quiet, because the non-data
    check scans the whole argv rather than only flag POSITIONS. Bounding it needs
    to know which flags take values on which subcommand -- the same open set --
    and the spelling has no occurrence in the 177,949-command replay. Direction is
    SILENCE, recorded here so it is not a surprise.
  * ``_explicit_limit`` likewise does not skip flag VALUES, so a literal
    ``--limit`` sitting in another flag's value is read as a limit. MEASURED:
    ``gh pr list --jq --limit`` goes silent, and ``gh pr list --template -L30``
    fires claiming a default was restated when no limit was passed. Pre-existing
    and the same open set; noted because the last-wins rewrite touched this
    function without closing it.
  * A blind parse is REPORTED rather than guessed at. ``analyze_checked`` returns
    no segments at all when a bound stops the parse, so the hook would otherwise
    fall silent on exactly the commands it cannot see -- see ``_blind_advisory``.
    MEASURED over 177,949 real Bash calls: 287 gh-bearing commands (1.46% of the
    19,607 gh-bearing ones) report a blind spot, and ZERO of those were
    bounds-induced. So the silence this closes is CONSTRUCTIBLE rather than
    observed, which is why the lock on it is structural
    (``test_untokenizable_probe``) rather than a rate.

    * The remedy was executed against ``gh pr list`` and generalised to all

      --limit is refused above :data:`_SEARCH_CEILING` -- so they get their own
      escape rather than advice gh will reject.

      true only of a SATURATED read. Correct as far as it went -- but the
      correction that followed it, "a short result is the TRUE count", was
      itself FALSE and is the premise this text no longer makes. The saturated
      half survives; the short half does not.

    THE CLAIM THAT WAS DELETED, and why no carve-out replaced it. A short read is
    not proof of completeness, because GitHub shortens a response for reasons the
    command cannot see: a FILTERED ``gh run list`` is served by the workflow-runs
    endpoint (at most 1,000 results for such a search); ``gh pr list --search``
    and ``gh issue list --search`` route through GitHub search and stop at 1,000;
    and a TIMED-OUT ``gh search`` returns fewer rows than asked for with
    ``incomplete_results: true``. Three consecutive review rounds each found
    another family where one sentence failed, so the sentence went rather than
    gaining a fourth exception.

    THE STANDARD THAT REPLACES "executed against the live tool", which is what an
    earlier docstring claimed while only one subcommand had ever been tried:
    every branch of this text is executed against EVERY family it addresses.
    Note what that standard could NOT catch, recorded because it is the honest
    limit: the date-slice escape was RUN, and each slice came back short of its
    own limit -- which was then read as "provably complete". Executing a remedy
    shows it does not ERROR. It does not show the INFERENCE drawn from its output
    is sound, and here the inference was the defect.

    1. ``--paginate`` prescribed; all 13 table subcommands reject it.
    2. ``gh search`` refuses ``--limit`` above :data:`_SEARCH_CEILING`, so "raise
       the limit until the result is short" is unfollowable there.
    3. This branch asserted "every gh listing is capped by default" and
       prescribed ``--limit``. MEASURED: ``gh secret list --limit 100`` answers
       ``unknown flag: --limit``, likewise variable/alias/ssh-key/gpg-key list.
    4. Its replacement said a command with no ``--limit`` line is not capped.
       MEASURED: ``gh api repos/cli/cli/issues --jq length`` returns **30** with
       no such flag -- one PAGE. That sentence certified a capped read as
       complete, which is worse than silence and is the precise failure this
       hook exists to prevent.
    5. Its replacement routed the reader to the command's own ``--help``.
       MEASURED: ``gh search prs --help`` advertises
       ``--limit int ... (default 30)`` and does not mention the 1000 ceiling
       ANYWHERE, so that route hands defect 2 straight back.

    Every one of the five is a branch with no resolved target prescribing a
    mechanism. Naming no mechanism is what makes the class unreachable rather
    than merely fixed again.

    ``found_any`` is not cosmetic. Three of the five blind causes return segments
    alongside the blind spot, so this block and a per-target block are emitted
    TOGETHER -- and saying "I could not check whether it contains a gh listing"
    directly beneath a block that just named one and stated its cap is a message
    contradicting itself in one breath. The claim that survives both cases is
    about what else might be there.
