"""Bounded stdout for hooks whose output reaches the model.

Claude Code PERSISTS a hook's stdout above a size threshold: the whole output
goes to a file under the session's ``tool-results/`` directory and the model
receives a ~2 KB preview. Nothing errors. The hook's contribution to that window
is simply gone, and the failure is indistinguishable from success.

MEASURED on CC 2.1.246 (2026-08-30, ~25 probe sessions; method and the literals
in ``docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md``):

* the threshold is **10,000 CHARACTERS** — 10,000 arrived inline, 10,001 was
  filed; 6,000 two-byte characters (12,044 bytes) arrived inline, so the unit is
  characters, not bytes. READ from the installed bundle as the literal ``1e4``
  on the hook-persistence path;
* it is **per hook ENTRY**, not per event — two SessionStart entries emitting
  9,000 characters each both arrived inline;
* it **moves between versions**: on 2.1.218 it sat near the high 20 Ks; the
  2.1.246 update dropped it to 10,000 and the filing rate tripled the same day.
  Whether it can move WITHOUT a version bump is UNVERIFIED.

Only SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit and UserPromptExpansion put a hook's bare
stdout in front of the model (READ from the bundle's attachment renderer, and
corroborated by the published hooks reference, which also names
``PostModelSwitch``). Every other event reaches the model only through JSON
``additionalContext`` / ``systemMessage`` — and each of those strings is run
through the SAME persistence path, which is why :func:`print_json_bounded`
exists alongside the plain-text helper.

**This module is the single home of that constant.** A hook that prints to the
model without going through here is one CC update away from silently losing its
output, and the repo has no other place where the number is written down.

Stdlib-only by contract, like ``hook_input.py``: a broken venv must never be
able to wedge a session through this path.

    The ENVELOPE is never sacrificed. A hook's JSON carries both a decision

    explaining it; if the serialised payload crossed the cap and the harness
    persisted it, a consumer would get a preview instead of parseable JSON and
    the DECISION would be lost, not merely shortened. So oversize is paid for
    out of the named free-text fields — longest first — and the envelope always

        named path is absent or not a string; a warning naming the reason goes
