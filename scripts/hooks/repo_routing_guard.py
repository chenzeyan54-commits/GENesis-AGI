"""PreToolUse hook: catch wrong-repo ``git add`` / ``git commit``.

The OMI incident (2026-07): a session built edge-device software (esphome /
firmware / s2s_bridge) into the AGI codebase, blind to the separate
GENesis-Voice repo. This hook is the deterministic backstop — it identifies the
CURRENT repo by its ``origin`` remote, then flags staged/added files whose path
(or, for new files, content) belongs to a DIFFERENT repo per
``repo_topology.yaml``.

Contract (matches the other Genesis PreToolUse hooks):
- Input via the CC hook payload on stdin (JSON with a ``command`` field).
- STRONG match -> BLOCK: message to stderr, exit 2.
- WEAK match  -> ADVISORY: ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` on stdout, exit 0.
- No match / not a git add|commit / anything unexpected -> exit 0 (fail-open).
- Override: append ``# repo-routing-override`` to the command to bypass.

Fail-open is load-bearing: this hook must NEVER block a legitimate commit. Every
failure path returns 0. The WS-C ambient-awareness layer is the upstream net;
this guard is a precise, deterministic backstop, not a wall.

Known limits (accepted, documented):
- ``bash -c "..."`` nesting or multi-``cd`` chains can defeat cwd inference; the
  guard fails open in those cases (the ambient lane is the net).
- ``git commit --amend`` sees only the staged delta, not the files already in
  the commit being amended.
- Topology is matched by ``origin`` remote; a repo with no origin is not guarded.
- Exotic command shapes degrade in the FAIL-SAFE direction (broader scan, never
  a missed detection): a pathspec/message token literally equal to ``git``/``cd``
  truncates arg collection, and space-separated global flags (``git --git-dir P
  commit``) are not value-skipped like ``-C``/``-c``. Agent-issued commands here
  use ``git -C`` / ``cd && git``, both handled and tested.

Runtime requirement: PyYAML. It is always present in the Genesis venv (this hook
runs via ``genesis-hook``, which invokes that venv's python). If ``yaml`` is
unavailable the guard prints a visible NOTE to stderr and fails open (disables
itself) rather than crashing.

#
# DELIBERATELY NARROW, and the narrowness is the point. shlex has already erased
# the quoting by the time a token reaches here, so a wider class cannot tell an
# expansion from a quoted LITERAL that merely contains the same character. A
# first version added `[{()<>` and MEASURED a real cost: `cd '/srv/a (wt)'`
# names a directory that exists, is a git repo and held a wrong-repo hit, and
# the guard stopped checking it. The class was over-covering as well as
# under-covering — an open set in both directions.
#
# The positive validation in main() (`not os.path.isdir(git_dir)`) closes the
# rest of the class without enumerating anything: a bracket-glob that expands to
# nothing, a brace expression, a literal that does not exist — all fail the
# is-it-a-real-directory test and are reported. Enumerating what bash expands
# only ever catches the constructs somebody thought of; asking whether the
# answer exists catches the ones nobody did.
#
# NOT a parity claim: the sibling resolvers (git_push_guard,
# review_enforcement_commit, pre_push_privacy_review) each carry their OWN
# class and they are NOT identical — review_enforcement_commit's is wider and
# also handles `cd -`, a bare `cd` and CDPATH. An earlier comment here asserted
# they matched; they do not. Canonicalizing the four copies is filed as a
# follow-up rather than done here, because the shared module it belongs in is
# being edited by another open branch.

    and the invocation was dropped at the ``if not origin`` guard. That reads
