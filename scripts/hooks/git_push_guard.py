"""PreToolUse hook: block git push/merge to main without user approval.

Catches all variations of pushing to or merging into the main branch:
- git push (bare, when on main)
- git push origin main
- git push -u origin main
- git merge <branch> (when on main)
- gh pr merge (without --admin — requires explicit user approval flag)
- gh pr merge with unresolved review findings (ERROR/[P1]/HARD BLOCK)

Stdlib-only. Fail-open on parse errors (don't block legitimate work).

Threat model (declared — the standing triage rule for the merge gate)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a PROCESS gate for a SINGLE-AUTHOR, single-remote, github.com repo whose
PRs target the default branch. It defends the SESSION'S OWN process failures, not
an adversary:

  * merging a head Codex never reviewed, or reviewed at an earlier commit
    (``_check_codex_reviewed_head`` + the ``--match-head-commit`` binding);
  * a race with the session's OWN later push between check and merge (same
    binding — GitHub enforces it server-side);
  * an ACCIDENTAL wrong-repo merge — a bare merge run from another checkout or
    after a ``cd`` (``_derive_repo_from_cwd``); or an unresolvable ``--repo``;
  * an ACCIDENTAL base retarget that silently invalidates the review, since the
    head never moves (``_check_base_is_default``);
  * an unreadable mergeability / review status read as "clean" (allowlist
    posture: block unless a DEFINITE good value — MERGEABLE, a current review).

It does NOT model a malicious operator crafting argv to defeat the gate (they own
``--admin`` and ``# review-override`` already), NOR a multi-actor repo where a
hostile collaborator force-pushes or retargets. Findings outside this model
(adversarial argv shaping, hostile-collaborator timelines, non-github hosts) are
OUT OF SCOPE BY DESIGN — reply as such rather than adding another patch. The
cluster-safe ``--match-head-commit`` parse + fail-closed shadow-flag belt already
exceed the model (defense-in-depth), which is fine; they are not an invitation to
chase every argv-shaping edge. Conscious escapes are split by boundary so one
waiver cannot silently disarm an unrelated gate: ``# review-override`` waives the
FINDING scans (review-body + inline P1s), ``# stale-review-override`` waives the
review-CONTEXT gates (Codex-at-head freshness + base-is-default),
``# scheduled-review-override`` waives the SCHEDULED-Claude-review-at-head gate, and
``# ci-override`` waives the CI gate — red/pending everywhere, plus (canonical repo
only) "absent" (empty rollup: CI never ran) and "incomplete" (partial rollup: a
REQUIRED workflow — ``merge_gate.required_ci_workflows`` in genesis.yaml, default
``CI`` — contributed no verdict; see ``_required_ci_workflows``). A session that
genuinely needs several appends several (one trailing comment may carry multiple
sigils).

Hook-surface merge teeth (2026-08-23): a PR whose diff touches the
ENFORCEMENT-HOOK surface (``_HOOK_SURFACE_PREFIXES``/``_HOOK_SURFACE_FILES`` —
the code these gates themselves run on) gets stricter freshness handling: its
stale-review delta is never "review-trivial", and ``# stale-review-override``
alone cannot merge it — recorded fallback-review evidence keyed to the exact
head sha is additionally required (``_hook_surface_override_check``; the block
message documents the user-authorized fallback procedure).

Scheduled Claude review markers
-------------------------------
A "scheduled Claude review" runs on the repo OWNER's GitHub account (NOT a bot) and must
post a comment (issue comment) or PR review whose body contains a marker
``<!-- genesis-scheduled-review: head=<full-40-hex-sha> kind=<name> -->`` naming the exact
head it reviewed AND which routine it was (``kind``). The merge gate
(``_check_scheduled_claude_reviewed_head``) blocks unless an owner-authored marker for
EVERY effective required kind (``_required_scheduled_review_kinds()`` — DEFAULT ``leaks``
alone, which is also irreducible; ``code-review`` is ADVISORY by default because no
routine emits its marker, and an install that runs one re-arms it via
``merge_gate.required_scheduled_reviews`` in genesis.yaml) names
the PR's CURRENT head — so if any required routine never ran, ran on a stale commit, or
was rate-limited, the merge is blocked (naming the missing kinds). An ADVISORY routine
still posts its review on the PR to be read
and addressed, but its absence does not block. SCOPE: this gate
enforces ONLY when the merge targets the configured PUBLIC repo — the declared
``github.user``/``github.public_repo`` in ``~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml``
(``_scheduled_gate_applies`` / ``_canonical_public_repo``). A merge to any OTHER repo
(a private fork, the voice repo, backups) no-ops, since the required ``/schedule``
routines run only on the public repo. Deployment note: on the public repo the leaks
routine IS configured (the deploy precondition); a clone that runs on its own public
repo without a producer uses `# scheduled-review-override` — since the only default kind
is the irreducible one, config cannot relax it, and the override valve is the escape by
design, not an opt-in flag. Fail-closed on scope uncertainty: if the canonical repo is undeterminable
the gate ENGAGES rather than silently disarming.
A DISMISSED or PENDING (draft) review no longer vouches (its marker is ignored), mirroring
the Codex path. The marker means "ran CLEAN", not merely "ran": a review whose body carries a
blocking finding ([P1]/HARD BLOCK/### ERROR, unless a clean marker overrides — the same rule
the finding scanners use) is rejected, so a scheduled reviewer that explicitly BLOCKED cannot
stamp a passing marker (owner-authored bodies are not seen by the bot-only finding scanners).
On the normal path this is ATOMIC: the Codex-freshness gate's ``--match-head-commit``
binding pins the merge to the very head the marker was verified at, so a race with a new
push cannot swap in an unreviewed head. Under ``# stale-review-override`` (which waives
that binding for ALL gates — a conscious "merge without current verification" choice) the
scheduled check is point-in-time, matching the reduced posture the operator already opted
into; it is not additionally head-bound there.
The marker is the trust anchor (single-author, non-adversarial threat model): this gate
defends against a review that did not run at HEAD, NOT against the owner's own review
automation being manipulated (e.g. prompt-injected by attacker-controlled PR content) into
posting a false marker — that guarantee lives in the scheduled-review producer, which must
not treat untrusted PR content as instructions when composing its comment body.

    supersession the successful run STARTS when the cancel fires and finishes a whole
    job later, so a tie is not even the shape this drop exists to recognise; a tie is
    far likelier to be two unrelated runs, or a genuinely-cancelled latest attempt.
    An unprovable ordering therefore fails CLOSED, like every other unresolvable case
    below. MEASURED before tightening (the Actions runs API over 400 runs / 2 days,
    30 real cancelled jobs on 25 shas): 18/30 had a strictly-later success, 12/30 had
    none, and **0/30 turned on a tie** — so this costs nothing observed, and 30 is a
    small denominator, which is precisely why the direction matters more than the
    rate: being wrong here over-blocks, it cannot wrong-green.

    THE ONE home of that rule. It had two: ``_pr_ci_status`` (which has always
    applied it) and ``_mechanical_scan_is_green`` (added later, which re-derived a
    naive ``all(c == "SUCCESS")`` and never handled a cancel at all). A doubled
    workflow dispatch — two ``pull_request`` runs for one sha, leaving EVERY
    check-run as a success+cancelled pair — made the two disagree about one payload
    inside ONE process: ``ci: green`` alongside "'leak-detector' is not green at
    this head", a message that sends the reader to inspect a job that is green.
    Deterministic for as long as that head stands, not a flake. Any FUTURE consumer
    of check-run conclusions calls this rather than re-deriving it a third time.

    Every condition below fails CLOSED — a cancel that cannot be PROVEN superseded
    is returned, and the caller's own red/not-green logic then sees it:

    * Only GitHub Actions CheckRuns with a resolvable identity AND a ``completedAt``
      may serve as the superseding sibling (``_ci_identity`` → None for a legacy
      StatusContext or a non-Actions check; a timestampless SUCCESS is skipped). So
      a StatusContext SUCCESS can never drop a same-named CheckRun cancel.
    * A cancel with no identity, no ``completedAt``, or no qualifying success STAYS.
      That includes SUCCESS-then-cancel on an unchanged head: the latest attempt
      never passed, so nothing supersedes the cancel.
    * ONLY ``_CI_CANCEL_CONCLUSIONS`` (deliberately ``{"CANCELLED"}`` alone) is
      droppable. FAILURE / TIMED_OUT / ACTION_REQUIRED / STARTUP_FAILURE / STALE
      carry real verdicts and are never dropped, whatever completed beside them —
      so this can never widen into "ignore anything that is not SUCCESS".
    * Non-terminal entries (an in-flight re-run) are not conclusions and are never
      touched; the caller still counts them PENDING.
    * Entries that are not dicts are passed through untouched, so a caller's own
      shape checks still see the payload it was given.

    Comparison PARSES both ``completedAt`` values and compares datetimes, in both
    passes. This is NOT the pulled #1420 finding-magnet, which sorted the WHOLE set
    (including QUEUED runs with a null ``startedAt``) to pick a global "latest".

    IT USED TO BE A LEXICOGRAPHIC STRING COMPARE, and the reason it no longer is
    was written down here before it was acted on. GitHub's GraphQL ``completedAt``
    is emitted as second-precision UTC with a literal ``Z`` (MEASURED 2017/2017
    entries across 122 PR rollups — every one ``Z``-suffixed with no fractional
    part). That is an OBSERVATION, not a contract: the schema documents the
    ``DateTime`` scalar only as "An ISO-8601 encoded UTC date string", which
    constrains neither sub-second precision nor the offset spelling. String order
    equals chronological order only while EVERY value shares one format, and two
    real shapes break it — a ``+00:00`` offset instead of ``Z``, and fractional
    seconds (``'Z'`` sorts ABOVE ``'.'``, so a SUCCESS at ``:00Z`` compares as later
    than a cancel at ``:00.9Z`` and wrongly drops it). The consequence is not
    cosmetic: `_mechanical_scan_is_green` consumes this, so a reversed ordering
    drops a real cancellation and carries an old leaks review forward — and under
    ``# ci-override`` that relief is the only remaining check of the mechanical
    layer. An observation is not a thing to gate on when parsing costs one call.

    ``_ci_completed_at`` fails CLOSED on anything it cannot parse into an
    OFFSET-AWARE datetime, including a naive value: an unparseable SUCCESS cannot
    supersede anything, and an unparseable CANCEL is kept. Naive is excluded rather
    than assumed-UTC because comparing naive against aware raises, and guessing a
    zone to avoid that is how a wrong-green gets built.

# A P1 inline finding on a DOCUMENTATION file is not a code defect and must not
# block a merge (a CHANGELOG typo, a README wording nit). This is a FAIL-CLOSED
# ALLOWLIST — a path is exempted only when it is provably prose; everything else
# blocks. Prose is: (1) a known doc-named file (CHANGELOG/README/LICENSE/NOTICE/…)
# with a doc/text/empty extension, at any depth; (2) any UNAMBIGUOUS documentation
# extension (.md/.rst/.markdown/.adoc) UNDER a top-level ``docs/``; or (3) any
# ``*.rst`` anywhere. A random top-level ``NOTES.md``, ANY source/config/executable
# file even under ``docs/`` (``docs/conf.py``, ``docs/build.rs``, ``docs/config.yaml``,
# ``docs/Makefile``), a missing/empty path, or a path bearing a control character is
# NON-doc and STILL BLOCKS — the gate never opens for a code path merely mislabeled.
# ``.txt`` is deliberately NOT a blanket doc extension: it is ambiguous (a build/dep
# manifest — ``docs/requirements.txt``, ``docs/CMakeLists.txt`` — carries it too, and
# this repo classifies such files as config), so ``.txt`` is prose ONLY on a known
# doc-named stem (``LICENSE.txt``, ``README.txt``). Only the inline endpoint carries
# a per-file path; the review-BODY gate is PR-level and stays unfiltered. (A denylist
# of code extensions was rejected in review: it can't enumerate every source/config
# type — an allowlist fails closed on the unknown.)

    OWNER DECISION 2026-09-04: a documentation extension is prose AT ANY DEPTH,

    treated as code, so a finding on ``AGENTS.md``, ``CLAUDE.md`` or any
    ``.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`` could block a merge. The old narrowness was
    deliberate — a ``.md`` here is often an executable prompt surface rather than

    COMMIT-time gate classifies those files independently via
    ``review_enforcement_commit._is_prompt_surface`` ("behavior surface —
    reviewable, never docs-skipped"), so editing them still requires an
    adversarial review. What changes is only whether a REVIEWER'S FINDING on a

    turns this back on.

# Robust bare-keyword match (the historical approach). A SINGLE statement keyword
# is inherently immune to shell quoting/escapes AND SQL comments BETWEEN tokens,
# because it never depends on two tokens being adjacent in the raw command. The
# ONLY refinement over the historical pattern is a negative lookahead excluding a
# keyword immediately followed by `(` — i.e. the `replace(...)` scalar FUNCTION
# (or any keyword-as-function) — so a read-only SELECT using replace() no longer
# false-positives. This is strictly narrower than the old pattern for reads and
# IDENTICAL for writes (no real write statement is `KEYWORD(`), so it cannot open
# a bypass. Detection stays on the WHOLE command so a heredoc/`bash -c`/wrapper
# cannot fragment and hide a write.
#
# Two earlier approaches were REJECTED for weakening the guard, and this returns
# to the robust original: (a) exe-scoping + a read-only exemption exempted
# read-only tokens appearing in write SQL *data* and missed heredocs/wrappers;
# (b) statement-position two-token matching was bypassable by a SQL comment or a
# shell escape/quote inserted between the two tokens (`DELETE /*c*/ FROM`,
# `DELETE\ FROM`, `DELETE' 'FROM`). A single-keyword match has neither failure.
#
# Accepted limitation (NOT a regression — the historical guard did the same): a
# command that merely MENTIONS a bare keyword alongside "sqlite3" without a write
# (a `grep 'sqlite3 … DELETE' file`, or a read whose STRING VALUE is a keyword
# like `WHERE s='DELETE'`) still matches. Excluding those needs real SQL/shell
# parsing — tracked as a follow-up, not worth reintroducing bypass risk for.

    ```suggestion``` blocks. `_` is simultaneously CodeRabbit's severity delimiter,
    markdown emphasis, AND the snake_case separator, so a body-wide search for a
    `_`-delimited severity word matches ordinary source. MEASURED against this

    replaces, since issue #1642 warns that poor precision trains reflex overrides.

    only if it is entirely one. Severity is read as the field's LAST word, never

    MEASURED on live PR #1647, comment id 3925021846: one comment carrying two
    distinct Major findings. Before this split, `_cr_severity` returned the
    first and the second existed nowhere in the gate's output. The dangerous
    ordering is Minor-then-Major: the comment scored as `minor`, landed in the
    advisory list, and printed "below Major, NOT counted" — a false claim about
    a Major that was never seen at all.

    A segment carrying no header is folded into the previous one rather than
    treated as a finding: a rule inside prose is not a finding boundary, and
    splitting on it would invent findings that do not exist. That fold is not
    sufficient on its own — it only catches a rule whose following segment has no
    header, and quoted markdown routinely supplies one. Rules inside fenced or
    ``<details>`` content are therefore not boundaries at all (see
    ``_cr_markup_mask``).

# ── CodeRabbit findings delivered in the REVIEW BODY, not inline ──
#
# When a finding's anchor line falls outside the PR's diff HUNKS, CodeRabbit
# cannot create an inline review comment for it, so it puts the finding in the
# review BODY under a collapsible section instead. NEITHER existing scan sees
# these: `_check_inline_review_findings` reads `pulls/N/comments` (a different
# endpoint entirely), and `_check_pr_review_findings` gates on `_REVIEW_BOTS`,
# which does not contain CodeRabbit.
#
# MEASURED 2026-09-07, all 84 then-open non-draft PRs: 27 deduped findings
# across 23 PRs — 15 Major, 12 Minor, 0 Critical — none of which any gate could
# see. Two were floor-class: a silent-write-loss Major (#1806
# `memory/store.py`) and a privacy Major (#1820 `inbox/monitor.py`), on PRs
# that read `inline-findings: ok`.
#
# Three shapes the parser must survive, each verified against a live body:
#   1. The section appears BLOCKQUOTED (`> <summary>…`) when nested inside an
#      outer <details>, and bare otherwise — so nothing here anchors to `^`.
#   2. A PR can carry SEVERAL CodeRabbit reviews and the section may exist in
#      only one of them (#1834: absent from review 1, present in review 2), so
#      every review is read, never just the newest.
#   3. Section headers and FILE headers share the `<summary>NAME (N)</summary>`
#      shape; the section names are a closed set, so a summary matching one is
#      a section and anything else carrying a count is a file.

    THE DEPTHS ARE RETURNED, NOT DISCARDED, and that is the whole point of the

    the line's CONTAINER, and a renderer scopes a fence to its container. Drop

    Returns ``(entries, declared, declared_known)`` — the parsed findings, the
    total this body's own section headers SAY it carries, and whether EVERY
    matched section header actually stated a count. ``declared_known`` is what
    licenses the SURPLUS comparison: with any count absent, ``declared`` is an
    underestimate, so parsed-exceeds-declared would fire on well-formed input.
    The shortfall comparison needs no such licence — an underestimate can only
    make it more lenient, never false-positive. The format states its own counts
    ("Outside diff range comments (3)"), which is the one closed-set fact
    available about a third-party document nobody controls: it turns "did I
    parse everything?" from an unanswerable question into a comparison. Reading
    2 of 3 is the SILENT direction of failure on a merge gate, and every other
    CodeRabbit helper here carries a canary for what it read but did not
    recognise (``cr_unknown``, ``unmatched_bot``, ``header_seen``); without the
    declared count this one would have none. ``declared`` is 0 when a header
    omits its count — absent, not zero findings, and the caller only ever acts
    on a SHORTFALL.

    Each entry is ``(path, lines, severity, title)``, severity lower-cased
    and drawn from the SAME vocabulary as the inline path (``_CR_SEVERITIES``)
    so the two cannot drift into disagreeing about what 'major' means. A finding
    whose severity cannot be read is returned with severity ``""`` — surfaced by
    the caller as a canary, never silently dropped and never guessed at (the
    ``cr_unknown`` contract, one section over).

    The section runs from its own ``<summary>`` to the next SECTION summary or
    to end-of-body, so the tail of a body whose outside-diff section comes last
    gets walked — and MEASURED on live data that is the NORMAL case (3 of 5
    bodies), not an edge.

    What makes the tail walk safe is ONE guard, not two, and an earlier version
    of this docstring claimed two. CodeRabbit's trailing furniture DOES carry
    the file-header shape — ``<summary>📒 Files selected for processing (11)
    </summary>`` matches ``_CR_FILE_HEADER_RE``, in 11 of 11 real reviews — so
    ``current_file`` really is reassigned to a furniture heading on every live
    run. The only thing preventing a phantom finding is that no furniture line
    matches ``_CR_ENTRY_RE`` (a backticked line-range then a colon then a
    severity). That is a thin margin held by a single condition, which is why
    the declared-count reconciliation above exists: it monitors the margin
    instead of asserting it.

    """Scan review findings from BOTH delivery channels and apply a weighted score.

    Despite the name, this reads two endpoints. ``pulls/N/comments`` carries
    findings anchored inside the diff. ``pulls/N/reviews`` carries the ones
    CodeRabbit could NOT anchor inline (an "Outside diff range comments"
    section in the review body) — a channel no gate could see until 2026-09-07,
    when 27 findings across 23 open PRs were measured invisible, 15 of them
    Major and two floor-class.

    THE TWO CHANNELS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC. Only the INLINE channel feeds the score
    and the threshold. The review-body channel is ADVISORY AT EVERY SEVERITY —
    surfaced, never scored — and its incomplete-read canaries print a NOTE
    rather than blocking. That is a deliberate design decision taken at the
    escalation cap (2026-09-09): every fail-open this parser produced was
    reachable only because a mis-read of a third-party rendered document could
    move a blocking verdict, and the scoring path had never once fired on live
    data (0 Criticals in those 27 findings). An earlier version of this
    docstring described the symmetric design and outlived it by one commit —
    which is the failure mode a stale contract statement always has: a
    maintainer relies on enforcement the gate no longer provides.


    Returns (should_block, message). Each unresolved finding contributes to a review
    score — P1 = 1.0, P2 = 0.5 — and the gate blocks when the score reaches the
    threshold FOR THIS PR'S LANE (`_INLINE_SCORE_BLOCK_THRESHOLDS`): critical 1.0,
    standard 2.0, light 3.0. So two P2s stop a consequence surface, four ordinary
    code, six prose-and-tests. A P1 blocks in EVERY lane via the always-fix floor,
    before the score is consulted at all. A finding is EXCLUDED from the score when its thread has a MAINTAINER
    reply (engagement = consciously accepted), its path is documentation
    (``_is_doc_path``), or its path is OUTSIDE the PR's diff (issue #1728: a
    merge of main stamps base-branch findings onto the PR; scoring them makes
    the gate demand base-branch fixes as this PR's price — reconciliation must
    stay gate-neutral). Off-diff findings are surfaced with their paths so real
    ones can be routed to the base branch's tracker; a MISSING/null path always
    scores (never silently discount a finding this check cannot place), and an
    unreadable changed-file set scores everything (status quo) with a loud
    NOTE. Scoping leans on the Codex FRESHNESS gate as its backstop: code moved
    away from a reverted file re-enters the diff at the new head, where a current
    review is separately required — weakening that gate widens this one.
    The exclusions differ in VISIBILITY by design: doc-path and off-diff findings
    were auto-excluded by PATH (not engaged), so both are still SURFACED as NOTEs —
    scored P2s print as a WARNING, doc-path P1s/P2s and off-diff findings as NOTEs —
    nothing unaddressed is
    dropped. A maintainer-replied finding was CONSCIOUSLY ENGAGED (the reply IS the
    acknowledgement), so it is excluded from the report too: the pre-merge report shows
    what still needs attention, not what a maintainer already handled (re-listing every
    replied finding on each check would bury the live ones). An UNREADABLE or
    INCOMPLETE scan (gh error/timeout/malformed/clipped budget) ALWAYS blocks

    the whole target and a later one is not a second candidate to fall back on.

    count against.

    ``unreadable_flag`` is a dash token this walk does not model, encountered
    BEFORE any positional. It matters because an allowlist on the target's VALUE
    is only as good as the walk that decides WHICH token the target is, and that
    walk is the part that can still be a list of spellings. Its failure is
    silent and in the wrong direction: gh's own parser bundles short flags, so
    `-ewR o/r <target>` passes `o/r` to ``--repo`` and leaves the real target
    two tokens later — while a walk that merely SKIPS the unrecognised `-ewR`
    hands back `o/r`, an innocuous literal, and never looks at the target at
    all. So an unmodelled flag makes the identity unreadable rather than being

    needs.

    THE CLASS, not a list of spellings. The cap counts rounds on ONE pull
    request in ONE repository, so exactly two values decide what it counts: the
    positional target, and the repository (an explicit ``--repo``/``-R``, or the
    OWNER/REPO carried inside a URL target). A PreToolUse hook sees the command
    BEFORE the shell runs, so a value carrying an expansion is not a value yet —
    and screening for the expansions one can name is a losing shape: ``$n`` is
    one spelling; ``$@``, ``$*``, ``${!v}``, ``${#v}``, ``$$``, ``$!``, ``$?``,
    ``$#``, ``$-``, ``$(…)``, backticks and legacy ``$[…]`` are eleven more, and
    the next round's finding is whichever one nobody enumerated.

    So this ALLOWLISTS, per the house rule that a contract guard names what is
    PERMITTED rather than what it imagined being attacked. gh documents the
    target as ``[<number> | <url> | <branch>]`` and the repo as
    ``[HOST/]OWNER/REPO``; each is accepted only when spelled in characters that
    are inert to the shell, so it expands to itself. Every other spelling —
    present and future — is refused by construction, without this function
    knowing anything about shell expansion syntax.

    Two fail-opens are DELIBERATELY kept, both documented and both locked by
    tests: a request with NO positional at all (nothing to count against), and a
    literal branch target (resolvable by anyone who cares to look it up).

    The cost, stated plainly because it is real: ``shell_parse._argv`` runs
    ``shlex.split`` first, so quoting is already gone by the time argv exists,
    and a branch LITERALLY named ``$PR`` — legal per ``git check-ref-format``,
    written ``'$PR'`` — is indistinguishable here from a live expansion and is
    refused. Recovering it means deciding expandability from raw quoting, i.e.
    hand-written shell-quote analysis inside the guard, whose failure direction
    is a reopened bypass rather than a rewrite. One rewrite with a literal PR
    number is the cheaper side of that trade, and the refusal names the remedy.

    MEASURED 2026-09-08 — why a BLOCK and not an advisory: writing the request
    as ``for n in 1625 1576 1609; do gh pr comment $n --body "@codex review";
    done`` posted round requests on two PRs already at or past
    ``ESCALATION_ROUND_CAP`` with no ``# escalation-ack`` and none of the
    step-back triage the block exists to force. The cap is itself a block, so an

    """Block a ``gh pr comment … @codex review`` once the PR already carries
    ``ESCALATION_ROUND_CAP`` Codex reviews, until a trailing ``# escalation-ack``.

    Companion to the commit gate's Rule 3 (review_enforcement_commit.py): that
    counter tracks LOCAL review→fix rounds and stays asleep when every local
    review is clean while the loop churns through CODEX rounds on the PR — the
    exact blind spot of the 2026-08-12 MW-3 #1372 whack-a-mole (5 Codex rounds,
    local counter at 0). This gate counts the PR's actual Codex reviews from the
    GitHub API (stateless, authoritative) at the one moment the groove happens:
    requesting the next round.

    FAIL-OPEN state table (advisory logic must never break workflow — the
    opposite posture from the fail-closed merge gates, on purpose):
      segment isn't `gh pr comment`               → untouched
      comment without an '@codex review' body     → untouched (body-file/stdin
        bodies are unresolvable here — documented coverage limit, fail-open;
        blocking unresolvable bodies would false-block non-trigger comments)
      '# escalation-ack' trailing ANY segment     → allow the whole command (a
        nested `bash -c '…' # escalation-ack` carries the ack on the OUTER
        segment; the ack is a conscious human-directed act, so one ack licenses
        the command it trails) — BUT ONLY BELOW THE TERMINAL. At or past
        FINAL_ROUND_CAP it does not clear the block; '# final-round-accept' does.
        This is why the ack is no longer a top-of-function short-circuit: a
        short-circuit could never see the count it needed to be bounded by.
      rounds >= FINAL_ROUND_CAP, no final-accept → BLOCK with the terminal (an
        escalation-ack here is deliberately not enough)
      no positional / literal branch target       → that segment allows;
        SCANNING CONTINUES (an allowed segment must not shield a later one)
      identity not written literally (target OR
        repo)                                     → BLOCK. The one fail-CLOSED
        leg, and the ack does not clear it: `acked` is command-wide, so one
        sigil on a loop would license a round on every PR it touches. See
        `_unresolvable_identity` for why the accepted forms are an ALLOWLIST
      gh/API/parse error (ids is None)            → that segment allows, scan on
      rounds < ESCALATION_ROUND_CAP               → that segment allows, scan on
      cap <= rounds < FINAL_ROUND_CAP, no ack    → BLOCK with the step-back order
      any segment at rounds >= cap, no ack        → BLOCK with the step-back
        order (URL targets carry their OWN repo into the count — counting the
        hook cwd's repo for a cross-repo URL could produce a FALSE block)
    Any unexpected exception → allow (caught here, NOT left to run_guard's
    fail-closed exit-2, which would turn an advisory bug into a hard block).

# ── Hook-surface merge teeth (2026-08-23, user decision) ─────────────────────
# The ENFORCEMENT-HOOK surface is the code the merge/push/commit gates themselves
# run on: an unreviewed change here disarms every other gate, so it gets stricter
# review teeth than ordinary code. Two rules, both scoped to these paths:
#   1. A stale-review delta touching this surface is NEVER "review-trivial"
#      (_classify_post_review_delta): a "small single-file touch-up" to a guard
#      is exactly the change that must not skip re-review.
#   2. `# stale-review-override` alone cannot merge a hook-surface PR without a
#      current GitHub Codex review — it additionally requires recorded
#      fallback-review evidence keyed to the EXACT head sha
#      (_hook_surface_override_check). The GitHub Codex review is the required
#      evidence class (user decision, 2026-08-23); the fallback procedure
#      (user-authorized local codex / Claude Code adversarial review) is the
#      documented exception path, not a self-serve bypass.
# WHY this exists (the origin story — keep it, it is the anti-rationalization):
# on PR #1432 a hand-rolled findings query returned empty and was reported as
# "review-clean" while 13 real Codex findings (10 P1) sat on the PR; only this
# file's merge gate caught it. The lesson: the human-facing claim and the gate
# MUST run the same code path, and the gate's own code must never merge
# unreviewed. Tests: tests/test_hooks/test_git_push_guard_hook_surface.py.

#: this feature's defects. An age window is deliberately gone too: at roughly three
#: flushes a day the store answers "has this escape decayed into the routine path?"
#: only over YEARS, and a 90-day window deleted exactly the signal it exists to hold.
#: The row's field set is CLOSED, and the writer builds rows from THIS tuple — a
#: caller cannot add a field by passing one. See the no-free-text constraint on
#: ``_note_override``. ``base`` is deliberately absent: no gate on this path
#: returns the base ref without a second API read, and a field that is empty on

#: by a DIFFERENT gate is a real signal (it says the escape was reached for), but
#: it is not an override that took effect, and conflating the two would inflate
#: every count drawn from this file.
#:
#: WHAT IT IS NOT: `outcome` is the GUARD'S OVERALL VERDICT on the command, not a
#: statement that the sigil waived anything. A gate handed `force=True` returns
#: without evaluating its condition, so a sigil that was not needed — e.g.
#: `# scheduled-review-override` when every scheduled review is already present —
#: produces a row identical to one that bypassed a failing gate. Counting
#: "allowed" rows therefore counts commands that were allowed, and OVERSTATES how
#: often an escape actually did work. Recording per-gate effectiveness needs each
#: gate to report what it observed rather than short-circuit, which costs API
#: calls on a budgeted path; that is filed as a follow-up, not approximated here.
#:
#: "asked" is NOT a spelling of "allowed". ``_ask`` returns 0 while emitting a

    under ``scripts/`` or ``src/genesis/``, and nothing on disk. A gate promising an
    audit trail it does not keep is worse than one promising nothing: it invites use
    of the escape on the belief that it is recorded.

    The row is HELD until :func:`_flush_overrides` learns the gate's verdict, because
    "the sigil was appended" and "the sigil let a merge through" are different facts

    NO COMMAND OR COMMENT TEXT EVER REACHES THIS ROW, and there is no "reason" field

    ``_record_snapshots`` refuses to persist the command because "the Bash payload can
    carry credentials (``curl -H 'Authorization: …' && git checkout``) and this log is
    durable". An override sigil IS a trailing comment on a Bash command, so the only
    free text available here is command-line text, from a segment that may carry a
    token. ``**_ignored`` exists so a caller cannot smuggle text in by passing an extra
    keyword: the row is built from ``_OVERRIDE_LOG_FIELDS`` and nothing else.

    ``sigil`` is validated against ``shell_parse._KNOWN_SIGILS`` — a closed set, never
    free text. An unrecognised sigil notes nothing rather than persisting the caller's
    string.

    EVERY OTHER FIELD IS SHAPE-CHECKED for the same reason, because "the closed field
    tuple stops free text" was only true of the field NAMES. ``head`` arrives as

    text, of arbitrary length, which the operator typed — so it is stored only if it
    looks like a sha, and ``repo`` only if it looks like ``owner/name``. Anything else

    A branch that merges its base to catch up acquires every commit the base
    contributed. The raw ``reviewed...head`` compare cannot tell that from a
    force-push and reports all of it as unreviewed, so the gate demands a fresh
    review of code that was already reviewed on its own PR — MEASURED on this
    repo: PR #1847 showed 28 files / 7 commits after merging main, of which the
    branch's own change was 2 files. #1690 made catching up MANDATORY for every
    branch carrying a changelog entry, so this stopped being incidental.

    The question this asks instead: did the PR's OWN contribution change? Both
    sides are the PR's diff over its base — at review time and now — compared by
    file identity. It returns ``"inline"`` for exactly ONE finding: the two
    contributions are IDENTICAL. It never sizes a residual change, so its only
    two answers are "provably a pure base-advance" and None.

    That is a deliberate narrowing over a version that DID size the residual
    (Codex P1, #1849): the records available here are base-relative, so a
    contribution that SHRANK between the review and head presents small counts
    while the reviewed...head delta is large, and the sizing read as trivial. See
    the ``if changed:`` block below.

    NARROWING, so uncertainty fails CLOSED at every point it can be SEEN: a
    failing fetch returns None (the caller blocks), an unreadable identity
    withdraws the claim, an unreadable base move withdraws it, and a file the base
    touched that the branch ALSO touches is a collision rather than an advance.

    The one uncertainty it CANNOT see is file MODE, which the compare record does
    not carry at all. That is why the enforcement surface is declined outright
    rather than trusted to the identity — see the block above the hook-surface
    loop. On a NON-hook path a mode-only change still rides through as unchanged,

        with two endpoints, and the compare record reports only the DESTINATION
        as ``filename``; the blob is the destination's bytes. So a contribution
        that renames ``A -> B`` and one that renames ``D -> B`` present the same
        filename, the same blob and the same ``renamed`` status while deleting
        DIFFERENT files. MEASURED on this code before the fix: those two compared
        equal, the file dropped out of the changed set, and the branch's changed
        rename read as a base-advance.

        A record MISSING its ``sha`` must not compare EQUAL to another missing
        one. MEASURED on this code before the check: two absent shas matched, the
        file dropped out of the changed set, and a genuinely modified file read as
        a base-advance — a stale review allowed on changed code, which is the one
        outcome this refinement must never produce. Triviality is an exception
        granted on POSITIVE evidence; an identity that cannot be read is not it,
        so the whole claim is withdrawn rather than made on partial data.

    if the head cannot be read, or Codex has no review, the merge is BLOCKED. A

    the smart-delta narrowing that keeps the gate's teeth pointed at UNREVIEWED
    SUBSTANTIAL CODE instead of taxing every post-review typo fix (measured
    2026-08-11: a binary stale-blocks gate would have blocked 14/18 recent
    merges). An UNCLASSIFIABLE delta blocks — triviality is an exception granted
    only on positive evidence. ``force`` (a ``# stale-review-override`` on the

    finding scans; the two boundaries are independent) is the conscious escape

    requires recorded fallback-review evidence regardless of head-freshness — the
    same sigil waives ``_check_base_is_default`` and the evidence identity binds the
    BASE, which a head-only review cannot vouch for (see Codex #9 disposition below).

    Returns ``(should_block, message, verified_head)`` — ``verified_head`` is the
    full head oid this check verified/classified against (when not blocked and
    not forced — including the trivial-delta allow, so the merge is still bound
    to the exact head that was assessed); the caller binds the MERGE to it via

# OWNER's account (NOT a bot) and posts a comment/review body carrying the marker
# ``<!-- genesis-scheduled-review: head=<full-40-hex-sha> -->``. The gate blocks a
# merge unless such a marker — authored by the owner — names the PR's CURRENT head.
# The marker is the trust anchor (single-author, non-adversarial model): a spoofed
# marker needs the owner's account. Waived by ``# scheduled-review-override`` (the
# conscious "merge without a scheduled review" case — it didn't run / is rate-limited).
# A scheduled-review marker is an HTML comment ``<!-- genesis-scheduled-review:
# head=<40hex> kind=<name> -->``. Each SCHEDULED routine stamps its own ``kind`` so
# the gate can require that EVERY routine in ``_required_scheduled_review_kinds()`` ran
# on the current head — a single routine's marker no longer satisfies the gate on its
# own. head/kind are parsed from the marker BLOCK (order-tolerant) and BOTH must be
# present in the SAME marker to count.

# Default scheduled-review kinds the merge gate REQUIRES at head. A PR merges only when
# a valid owner-authored marker for EACH effective required kind names the current head.
# An install may EXPAND this set locally — see _required_scheduled_review_kinds().
#
# WHY code-review IS NOT IN THE DEFAULT. A required kind is a promise that some producer
# emits its marker. For `code-review` no producer exists: measured 2026-09-16 over every
# owner-authored comment and review on all 51 open non-draft PRs and the 40 most recently
# merged ones, `leaks` markers appear 47 and 31 times respectively and `code-review`
# markers appear ZERO times — not stale at an earlier head, never emitted at all. The gate
# consequently blocked 51/51 open PRs on a kind nothing produces, so every one of those 40
# merges necessarily carried `# scheduled-review-override`: a sigil that verifies NOTHING,
# demoted by daily use from an exception valve to the standard merge incantation. That is
# strictly worse than not requiring the kind, because it also disarms the override for the
# leaks lane, where it is the only escape. Requiring a marker no routine writes does not
# buy review; it buys a habit of waiving review.
#
# What is NOT lost: `code-review` is a QUALITY review, and per-head quality review is
# already enforced by two other gates that do have live producers — Codex-at-head
# freshness (_check_codex_reviewed_head) and the inline-finding thresholds
# (_check_inline_review_findings). Nothing about LEAK protection changes: `leaks` stays
# irreducible below, and the mechanical `leak-detector` CI job still runs per head.
#
# The kind remains KNOWN (_KNOWN_SCHEDULED_REVIEW_KINDS), so an install that DOES stand a
# producer up re-arms it with one line of local config:
#
#     # ~/.genesis/config/genesis.yaml
#     merge_gate:
#       required_scheduled_reviews: [code-review, leaks]
#
# Accepted residue: while the kind is advisory, a `code-review` marker whose body carries a
# blocking finding is not consulted — an advisory kind is neither required nor refusable.
# Inert today (no producer), and the config line above is what makes it bind again.
_DEFAULT_REQUIRED_SCHEDULED_REVIEW_KINDS = ("leaks",)
# The leak/secret scanner is IRREDUCIBLE: always required, never removable by config. A
# secret reaching a public repo is irreversible, so no local policy may waive it.
_IRREDUCIBLE_REQUIRED_SCHEDULED_REVIEW_KINDS = ("leaks",)

# Scheduled-review kinds whose marker may be honoured from an EARLIER head of the
# same PR, provided the named MECHANICAL scanner is green at the CURRENT head.
#
# WHY this exists, and why only for leaks. The routines are not re-run on a push,
# so on any multi-push PR the marker sits at the first head and the gate blocks —
# measured over ten recent PRs, every one with commits after its marker. The
# operator's only escape was `# scheduled-review-override`, a sigil that checks
# NOTHING, so routine use of it was eroding an override meant for exceptions.
#
# The relief is narrow BECAUSE the two layers cover different leak classes. The
# mechanical scanner catches literal patterns (addresses, emails, configured
# private patterns) and it runs per-head; the scheduled LLM review catches
# INFERENTIAL leaks, which no pattern can. Honouring an earlier LLM review while
# REQUIRING the mechanical one at this exact head therefore trades a re-read of
# the inferential layer for a guarantee the literal layer covers the new commits
# — strictly more checking than the bare override it replaces, never less.
#
# NOT a prose-delta tolerance. That was the first design and it was MEASURED
# inert: 0 of 6 applicable PRs had a prose-free delta (22-692 added prose lines
# each), because essentially every push adds a comment, docstring or string.
# A relief valve that never opens leaves the override in daily use.
# kind -> (check name, WORKFLOW name) for the mechanical scanner that may carry an
# earlier accepted review forward. The workflow half is the round-4 finding: matching
# the display name against the whole required-CI set lets a same-named check from
# ANOTHER workflow stand in for the real scanner. Both halves are read from this
# repo's own .github/workflows/ci.yml (`name: CI`; the `leak-detector` job), so they
# travel with a clone rather than describing one install. A suite named differently
# simply finds no match, and no match means NO RELIEF -- the pre-relief behaviour, so
# the failure direction of a wrong pin is a missing convenience, never a weaker gate.
#
# THE WORKFLOW HALF IS A DISPLAY NAME, AND A DISPLAY NAME IS NOT UNIQUE PROVENANCE.
# GitHub does not require `name:` to be unique across workflow files (its workflow-syntax
# reference states no such constraint; an OMITTED name falls back to the file path, which
# is unique — an explicit one is not). So a second file declaring `name: CI` with a job
# named `leak-detector` would share this tuple, and its SUCCESS could both supersede the
# real scanner's CANCELLED in _drop_superseded_cancels and satisfy the pin below.
# Real provenance exists in GraphQL (checkSuite.workflowRun.workflow.databaseId, or
# checkSuite.workflowRun.file.path) but `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` does NOT
# expose it — a rollup entry carries only __typename/completedAt/conclusion/detailsUrl/
# name/startedAt/status/workflowName, and detailsUrl's RUN id cannot separate a decoy
# from a legitimate re-run of the same file. Pinning on provenance therefore means
# replacing this gate's read path with a raw GraphQL query.
# Until then the PRECONDITION is closed instead of the consequence:
# TestWorkflowDisplayNameIsUniqueProvenance fails CI if two workflow files ever share a
# display name, or if this pin stops resolving to exactly one file. That is complete for
# the reachable case — workflowName is populated only for Actions check-runs, and those
# come from this repo's own workflow files; a non-Actions check-run has no workflowName,
# so _ci_identity returns None and it is never a sibling.

    Reads the STRICT grammar only, and deliberately so. An earlier revision also read a
    status-suffixed value (``kind=leaks/failed``) by taking the segment before the suffix,

    ``kind``, an author who is not the owner, a dismissed review. Every one of those

    provably describes the commit being decided: if the head returned alongside
    it is not *head_sha*, the read is discarded. That preserves the sha binding a
    ``commits/{sha}/check-runs`` read would give, while gaining ``workflowName``,

    REST check-runs list is, so a scanner cannot fall off a later page and read
    as absent (which would recreate the routine false block this relief exists to

    Identity is ``(name, workflowName)`` against the kind's PINNED workflow,
    mirroring ``_ci_identity``. A bare display-name match would let a same-named
    check from another app or workflow stand in for the real scanner — the decoy
    class this file already documents at _ci_identity, and the whole point of
    this relief is that the mechanical layer really ran.

    Returns ``(still_missing, relieved, reasons)``. Each *relieved* entry is
    ``(kind, ancestor_head_12, check_name)`` -- enough for both the operator note and
    the report line, so a carried-forward review is never rendered as one made at
    head. *reasons* maps a kind to WHY relief failed when a carriable marker existed:
    "the scanner has not finished" and "the scanner FAILED" call for opposite actions
    (wait vs fix that job), and neither is "re-run the scheduled review", which is
    what the message says when it only knows the marker sits on another head.

    THE RULE: **any refusal for the kind, anywhere in this PR, denies relief.**

    That is deliberately blunter than the predicate it replaces, which tried to
    establish that every refusal PREDATED the accepted review it was carrying, via a
    refusal-vs-candidate ancestry walk. Four review rounds found four different ways
    that reconstruction was wrong -- too permissive at one round (a refusal at the
    head overridden by an older acceptance), too strict at the next (an off-branch
    refusal false-blocking) -- which is the signature of a predicate the available
    data cannot support. The blunt membership test deletes the whole class: the
    nested loop, its per-refusal network compares, the merge-budget pressure they
    created, and the same-SHA collision case.

    Two things make the bluntness affordable rather than merely simpler.

    First, the OWNER'S CHRONOLOGY ALREADY RAN. ``_scheduled_review_marker_scan``
    resolves the owner's latest decisive statement per (head, kind) before this is
    reached, so a refusal later answered by a clean verdict AT THAT HEAD never
    reaches ``rejected`` at all. What lands here is a refusal the owner never
    retracted at the commit it was made about.

    Second, the head axis is NOT a time axis. A clean review of yesterday's code says
    nothing about today's, so a later acceptance at an older head must never outrank a
    refusal -- cross-head resolution may only ever ADD acceptance, never remove a
    refusal. A predicate that let one refusal be "answered" is exactly a predicate that
    can remove one.

    MEASURED cost, main's own scan over the 40 most recent PRs (all 40 carry a leaks
    marker): 14 are relief-eligible -- no accepted marker at head, one elsewhere --
    and this rule denies none of them; two PRs carry a refused row, both already
    satisfied at their final head. So the observed price of denying on any refusal
    is ZERO relief lost, and the fallback for the case that does occur is the
    override plus a human reading a leak finding -- the right outcome when a leaks
    review has refused.

    BLOCKING RESIDUE closes the one path that reads `rejected` alone would leave: a
    blocking finding the scan cannot credit to `rejected` -- a same-timestamp tie
    (neither map, by design) or a malformed / unknown-kind marker whose body reads as
    blocking. The scan now returns it STRUCTURALLY (``blocking_residue``, head -> kinds,
    "" for unattributable, "*" for kind-less), so this predicate denies on it without
    ever matching prose. An adversarial audit reproduced the hole before this existed:
    a [P1] body under a 12-char ``head=`` at HEAD -- a producer fault the scan records
    as observed live -- was carried over by the older clean review. On the 40-PR
    corpus, 7 PRs carry BENIGN unusable rows (re-posts, a short sha, a superseded
    refusal) and none carry residue: denying on residue costs nothing measured, where
    denying on any unusable row would have cost 7/40 on their next push.

    """Block a merge unless EVERY required scheduled Claude review (by the repo OWNER)
    has run on the PR's CURRENT head. Returns ``None`` when a valid owner marker for
    each kind in ``_required_scheduled_review_kinds()`` names ``head_sha`` exactly (full
    40-char), else a BLOCK MESSAGE naming the MISSING kinds.

    Fail-CLOSED — this gate never passes on absence of positive evidence: if the head
    cannot be read, or the comment/review fetch errors (``_scheduled_review_marker_scan`` →
    None), the merge is BLOCKED. A read that simply does not carry every required kind
    at this head (a routine didn't run, ran on a stale commit, or was rate-limited) also
    blocks. The merge path and the report path share this single fail-closed decision,
    so the report can never issue a false all-clear here.

    WHY THE BLOCK MESSAGE IS AN INVENTORY. Every marker block the scan found is listed
    under the kind it names with its status — accepted at another head, refused (here or
    elsewhere), or uncreditable with the reason — and nothing is subtracted from anything.
    The previous shape partitioned the missing kinds by cause and let one cause per kind
    win. Across six review rounds every finding on it was the same defect: the winning
    cause hid a fact the operator needed (a refused [P1] on an older commit, the only
    evidence a review had ever run, a field that was present but refused). Precedence is
    the right shape for the VERDICT, which needs one answer; it is the wrong shape for a
    REPORT, where hiding a true fact is never correct. The one conditional left is a
    count: a kind with zero rows gets the in-flight note, since "nothing found at all" is
    the only state where waiting can help.

    The message deliberately reports only what it OBSERVED (which heads carry markers)
    and hedges the schedule ("generally not re-run"). The routines live OUTSIDE this repo
    and this gate cannot see their triggers, so an unconditional claim about when they
    fire would be asserting a guarantee the code cannot back — and would become actively
    misleading on an install that also runs them on ``synchronize``.

    Head match is EXACT by default, and the code-review classifier must NEVER be
    reused here: ``_classify_post_review_delta`` judges CODE-REVIEW substantiality by
    file type and size, and an inferential leak (household/schedule/habit detail, not
    a token a regex can catch) arrives in exactly the small doc edit it would wave
    through. That prohibition is unchanged.

    The ONE tolerance that exists is the leak-specific one this docstring used to
    describe as "tracked separately": ``_relieve_kinds_by_mechanical_rescan`` may
    carry an ACCEPTED marker forward from an ANCESTOR commit of this PR, but only
    while the kind's MECHANICAL scanner is green at the exact current head, only
    never when any refusal or uncreditable blocking finding for that kind exists in the PR, and only for
    kinds in ``_MECHANICAL_RESCAN_BY_KIND``. It is not a delta tolerance: nothing is
    judged by how big or how doc-like the change is. It trades a re-read of the
    inferential layer for a per-head guarantee about the literal layer — strictly
    more checking than the ``# scheduled-review-override`` it exists to retire,
    which verifies nothing at all.

    SCOPE: this gate enforces ONLY for a merge targeting the configured PUBLIC repo
    (``_scheduled_gate_applies`` / ``_canonical_public_repo``). A merge to any other
    repo (a private fork, the voice repo, backups) returns None (no-op) — the
    required routines run only on the public repo, so they cannot be required
    elsewhere.

    ``head_sha`` (the caller's authoritative head) is used when given; otherwise the
    head is read via ``_pr_head_sha``. ``force`` (a ``# scheduled-review-override`` on
    the merge segment — an INDEPENDENT sigil from ``# stale-review-override``) waives
    this gate for the conscious "merge without the scheduled reviews" case (e.g. a
    routine is down / rate-limited).

    Used for BOTH sides of the comparison — one code path, so the head and base
    reads cannot drift apart in their fail direction (they did: the base side used
    a hardcoded local ``git show origin/main``, which is neither bound to the repo
    being merged into nor to the PR's actual base branch. On a checkout whose
    ``origin`` is a fork, a genuine forward bump could read as a DOWNGRADE and be
    exempted).

    NOT from the local checkout: the gate runs from the main worktree, which is on
    main, so the PR's version of the file is not on disk here. That is also the
    property making this gate un-editable by the PR — only the DATA comes from the
    PR, never the code reading it.

    verdict: no caller blocks on it. The merge arm prints an advisory NOTE and
    proceeds; ``--check-pr`` prints an ``advisory`` row that never counts toward
    `failures`. Keeping the severity in the CALLERS is what let this become
    advisory without touching a line of the classification below.

    GUARD AXIOMS, stated because every gate change owes them:
      * VERDICT: **advisory** (owner decision 2026-09-06, reversing the
        2026-09-05 hard-fail). A block only guaranteed that a SENTENCE EXISTS,
        never that it was true, so it added no determinism to the judgment —
        while taxing every merge on an n=2 justification. The obligation is
        MEANT to be carried by a per-merge row from the repo-pulse worker; that
        row is UNBUILT (issue #1718, half B), so in the interim this advisory is
        the only record. See the merge-arm comment.
      * AUDIENCE: the agent — and both callers print the WHOLE message, whose
        tail is the remedy (both valid forms plus, when the parser loaded,
        copyable examples). Printing only its first line silently drops that.
        Every ``undeclared`` return is built by ``_e2e_undeclared``, which
        appends the remedy, so this is a property of the code rather than a
        claim about it — the earlier wording asserted the tail was always
        GUIDANCE while three of the four returns omitted it.
      * BACKGROUND: none — background sessions cannot merge PRs by design.

    "Fail direction" now means which way an UNREADABLE input is REPORTED, since
    nothing blocks:
      * body UNREADABLE → reported undeclared. An unread body is an unanswered
        question, not a pass — the row will still be opened post-merge.
      * createdAt UNREADABLE, parser LOADED → reported undeclared, naming the
        cause, rather than assuming the pre-convention exemption.
      * createdAt UNREADABLE *and* parser MISSING → neither the exemption nor the
        stripping can be established, so this returns whatever the bare presence
        scan below finds: a body carrying an ``E2E:`` line is reported declared
        (degraded), one without it undeclared. Stating that exception here because
        the line above read as unconditional and is not (Kimi P3, 2026-09-06).
      * parser module MISSING → the body is still scanned for a bare ``E2E:``

    """Block a PR that moves the Claude Code pin FORWARD without its gate receipts.

    THIS is the authority for the receipt gates, not a CI status. The body is
    mutable after any CI run finishes, so a status describing it is a claim about
    the past; read at merge time there is no window to edit it afterwards. The
    CI job runs the same checker with ``--advisory`` purely for early feedback.

    BOTH sides are read through the API, against the repo actually being merged
    into and the PR's OWN base branch. An earlier revision read the base with a
    local ``git show origin/main`` — not bound to the merge target and hardcoding
    the branch name — so from a checkout whose ``origin`` is a fork (or whose
    ``origin/main`` is simply unfetched) the comparison ran against the wrong base,
    and a fork sitting on a HIGHER pin turned a genuine forward bump into a
    "downgrade" that the gate exempts. Head still comes through the API, so the
    code doing the reading is always main's copy.

    TWO AXES decide the fail direction, and they are independent.

    CONTENT vs PLUMBING. A fact about the PR's content blocks; a failure of this
    gate's own plumbing does not. An earlier revision phrased that first case as
    "the pin cannot be READ", which OVERLAPS the plumbing case on the one state
    that matters, and the code resolved the overlap fail-open — a >1MB pin blob
    (the API answers ``"encoding": "none"``) took the plumbing path. Hence the
    distinct UNDECODABLE outcome: present in the tree, bytes unobtainable, which is
    a fact about the PR.

    HEAD vs BASE. **No base-side condition returns a verdict of its own.** Base
    state belongs to ``main``: every open PR inherits it, no PR can repair it
    through this gate, and this gate has no override sigil — so a strict base rule
    wedges the repository rather than refusing one merge. But the base is not
    therefore harmless to ignore. It is an INPUT to the direction comparison, and
    when it cannot supply one, the checker requires the receipts in place of that
    comparison (``direction_verified=False``) instead of passing. A PR that repairs
    a malformed base and bundles a forward release in the same change is otherwise
    invisible to everything: its merge tree carries the REPAIRED pin, so lockstep
    passes and CI is green.

    THREE QUESTIONS, IN ORDER, and the order is the design
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Replaced (2026-08-29) a cascade of early returns over the product of
    (head state × base state × parse outcome). Four cells of that product were found
    to answer wrongly, across four review rounds — the signature of a shape that
    generates bugs, not of four bugs. Each question below is answered from the
    strongest evidence available for it, and none may be answered out of order:

      1. **Did this PR touch the pin file?** From the PR's own changed-file list,
         which GitHub computes against the MERGE BASE — the same thing the merge
         uses. Falls back to the blob SHA when that list is unavailable or
         truncated, and NEVER to the file contents: those are both ``None``
         whenever a read fails, so two different oversized blobs compared equal and
         reported an untouched pin.
      2. **Is the head pin usable?** Asked before any base-side branch runs. An
         earlier revision could return a base-side note first, so a PR introducing
         an empty pin file over an absent base merged with no usable pin at all.
      3. **Which direction, and are the receipts there?** Delegated whole to the
         checker, with a base-side fault passed as an INPUT rather than returned on
         — and with CONTENT (requires receipts) still distinguished from PLUMBING
         (non-blocking note), which is the axis above applied to the base side.

    # An untouched file cannot have moved the pin, whatever state it is in, so this is
    # the one question worth asking before anything is parsed — and the only one that
    # CAN be asked when nothing parses. Without it, a broken pin on the base wedges the
    # repo through the HEAD rule: a PR that never touches cc_version.sh inherits the
    # broken file at its own head. MEASURED before this existed: with an emptied pin on
    # the base, every PR that left the file alone was blocked.
    #
    # Answered FIRST from the PR's own changed-file list, which GitHub computes against
    # the MERGE BASE. Comparing the head tree with the base TIP instead gets one class
    # wrong: a PR that branched before the base's latest pin change still carries the
    # older blob at its head, so the two tips differ even though the merge will keep
    # the base's version and never touch the file. With a malformed new base pin, that
    # demanded receipts from exactly the stale unrelated PRs this wedge fix unblocks.
    #
    # The blob SHA remains the FALLBACK for when that list is unavailable or truncated
    # — never the file CONTENTS, which are both None for every unreadable state, so
    # "unchanged" got concluded from two reads having failed and two DIFFERENT >1MB
    # blobs bypassed the head-side block.
    #
    # Asked UNCONDITIONALLY, including when both sides read cleanly. Scoping it to the
    # unreadable states looks like an optimisation and is a bug: an EMPTY pin file is a
    # successful read (state OK, content ""), so an empty pin on `main` left both sides
    # OK, skipped this question, and blocked every PR on "the head pin is unparseable" —
    # the very wedge this exists to prevent, rebuilt out of the other three states.

    Every blocking gate message follows the same shape: line 0 SUMMARIZES and the
    lines below carry the actual diagnosis — which findings, which patterns, which
    cause. `check_pr_report` prints only line 0, so a gate whose summary ends in a
    colon reads as a sentence with its object cut off.

    MEASURED 2026-09-02 on PR #1611: `inline-findings: BLOCK — review score 1.0 >=
    1.0 blocks (...): 1 unresolved [P1] + 0 unresolved [P2] finding(s), none
    maintainer-replied:` and then nothing. The P1's title is in `msg` line 1 and was
    discarded. An operator is told a P1 blocks and never told WHICH — on the surface
    that exists precisely to tell them what to act on.

    Two gates already open-coded this loop (pin-receipts, scheduled-claude) and three
    did not (review-body, inline-findings, codex-at-head) — which is the whole bug.
    Every message-bearing gate goes through here so a new one inherits the behaviour
    instead of re-deciding it; `TestReportRendersGateDetail` locks that in BOTH
    directions (nobody re-implements the loop; nobody forgets to call it).

    The message is untrusted — it can carry inline review-comment titles — so it goes
    through `_sanitize_gate_text` first; see that function for what and why.

    REST endpoint — `chatgpt-codex-connector` vs `…[bot]` — matched nothing,
    and the empty result was reported as "Codex clean" while 5 P2 findings sat
    unread). Report and enforcement share these functions, so a bug in one is a
    bug in both. Both run the finding scans FAIL-CLOSED — an UNREADABLE or INCOMPLETE
    scan (gh error / clipped budget) shows as a failure here and BLOCKS a merge there;
    neither ever issues a false all-clear (PR #1434 removed the old merge-path fail-open).

    Prints one line per gate; returns 0 when every gate would pass, 1 otherwise.
    (Same CHECKS as enforcement, but the internal ORDER may differ — e.g. the merge
