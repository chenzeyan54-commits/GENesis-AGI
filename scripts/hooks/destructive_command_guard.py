"""PreToolUse hook (Bash): block rm with recursive+force on broad paths.

Catches rm with recursive+force flags targeting shallow paths that
could wipe important directories. A path must be at least 4 components
deep (e.g., /home/user/project/some_dir) to pass.

Blocks:  rm -rf /  |  rm -r -f ~  |  rm --recursive --force .  |
         rm -Rf ~/project  |  rm -rf -- /  |  rm -rf deep/path /
Allows:  rm -rf /home/user/project/.claude/worktrees/old-branch

Parsing is token-based (shlex): flags accumulate across tokens, `--`
ends flag parsing, and every operand is depth-checked individually —
the 2026-07-10 P1 triage empirically confirmed the old single-token
regex missed the `-r -f`, `--recursive --force`, `-Rf`, and `-- /`
spellings, and folded multiple operands into one pseudo-path.

Stdlib-only. Unparseable commands fall back to the legacy regex match
(fail-open beyond that — this guard must not block legitimate work).

#
# DESIGN (user decision 2026-07-24, "simple + catastrophe-safe" — see the code
# review saga in this file's git history): shlex erases the quoted/unquoted
# distinction (a file literally named `>` and a real redirect both tokenize to
# `>`), so redirect-shaped tokens are treated UNIFORMLY as redirects and skipped.
# The tradeoff is that a bizarrely-named file starting with `<`/`>` (e.g.
# `rm -rf ">etc"`) is allowed — deliberately accepted, because:
#   SAFETY PROOF — a skipped token always starts with `<`, `>`, or `&>` (or fd
#   digits then `<`/`>`). The always-block targets (`. .. / ~ *`) and every real
#   filesystem path never start that way, so skipping can NEVER drop a genuinely
#   dangerous target. And the guard never skips a token *following* a redirect,
#   so `rm -rf ">" /etc` still depth-checks and blocks `/etc`. All quote/escape
#   handling is left to shlex — no second, divergent parser (three such
#   divergences were bypasses across three review rounds, 2026-07-24).

# is a `!` negation applied to a subshell — a COMMAND-form paren whose `)` really
# does let a following `#` open a comment. MEASURED both ways with
# `!(true)#note; touch MARKER`: extglob off, no marker (a comment opened);
# extglob on, marker present (no comment). The two answers are incompatible, so
# the default that this hook actually runs under wins, and `!` stays out.
#
# ENUMERATED against bash 5.2, one member at a time, with `<prefix>#note; touch
# MARKER`: the marker appears iff `#` did NOT open a comment, so the `; touch`
# ran. That spelling is used deliberately instead of a trailing continuation —
# with `<prefix>#note \`⏎`touch MARKER`, folding leaves `<prefix>#note touch
# MARKER`, whose first word is an assignment prefix for the `a=(x)` case, so
# `touch` runs as the command word and the marker appears in BOTH directions.
# That confound reported array assignment as command-form, which it is not.
#
# Deliberately no worked example here. Naming a construct beside a statement
# that a gate stopped working is a recipe, and this repository is public; the
# repo's own prose tripwire forbids the pairing but cannot see every construct
# name, so its silence is not permission. The shapes live as fixture rows in the
# guard's tests, where they are data rather than instruction.
#
# Getting a member wrong is a bypass in one direction or the other: calling a
# word-form `)` a boundary lets a glued `#` fake a comment and hide the next
# line, and calling a command-form `)` mid-word folds a continuation the shell
# does not fold, gluing the next command onto the comment text so no `rm` token
# survives. Both directions are covered by fixture rows in the guard's tests.

    """Delete the line continuations the shell deletes — and only those.

    A whole-string regex cannot decide this, because whether a backslash-newline
    is a continuation depends on the CONTEXT it sits in. A ``#`` comment ends at
    the newline and the shell does not continue it, so folding there deletes a
    real command separator and glues the following command into the comment
    text: no ``rm`` token survives, and because tokenizing then SUCCEEDS the
    legacy-regex fallback (which fires only when tokenizing FAILS) never runs.

    Both error directions are bypasses in this guard, which is why this tracks
    state instead of approximating either one. Failing to fold a genuine
    continuation splits a word the shell joins and can hide the recursive-force
    flags — the bypass recorded in ``_rm_violations``. Folding one the shell
    does not join hides the command itself. Contrast ``shell_parse``, where the
    consumers only ever over-read, so an approximation is safe there and is not
    safe here.

    Quotes keep their previous treatment deliberately: a ``#`` inside them opens
    nothing, and the continuation is still folded, because the shell keeps the
    sequence literally inside single quotes and folding it changes one operand's
    spelling, never its depth or its flags.

    Odd/even parity falls out with no counting: an escaped PAIR is consumed
    here, so a newline following an even-length run is seen fresh and stays a
    real separator. ``_CONTINUATION`` is retained as the parity reference this
    is checked against.
