"""Shared shell-command analysis for guard hooks.

A security guard must classify what a Bash command ACTUALLY executes — its real
subcommands and flags — not what a substring or a naive regex suggests. The
naive approaches fail on, e.g.:

* a commit message that merely *mentions* ``git push`` (must NOT match),
* a quoted flag ``git commit '--no-verify'`` that the shell still passes (MUST
  match),
* a wrapper prefix ``sudo git push`` / ``env X=1 git push`` / ``/usr/bin/git
  push`` (MUST match),
* a nested script ``bash -c 'git commit -n …'`` (the inner command MUST be
  seen),
* a leading redirect ``git 2>/dev/null push`` / ``git 2>&1 commit`` whose
  operator must NOT be mistaken for the subcommand (the push/commit gates MUST
  still match — a leaking redirect once let these slip),
* an approval comment ``# review-override`` that belongs to ONE command segment
  and must not authorize the next.

This module centralizes that parsing so ``git_push_guard``,
``review_enforcement_commit``, and the destructive/path guards agree. Stdlib
only; fail-open (a segment that won't tokenize degrades to a naive split rather
than raising) — a guard must never crash the tool.

That fail-open degradation is SILENT by design, which means ``analyze()`` can
never report its own blind spot: "no gated segment found" and "no gated command
present" are indistinguishable in its return value. A caller that treats the
former as the latter fails OPEN. ``untokenizable()`` exists so a
security-critical caller can tell them apart and choose its own fail direction
at its own boundary — the parser degrades gracefully, each gate decides for
itself what an unverifiable command means. Callers must probe the RAW command:
normalizing text before a blind-spot probe can only ever delete the evidence
the probe looks for.

There is a SECOND blind spot, and it does not look like one, which is why it
needed its own rule. ``untokenizable`` answers "did the parse fail". It cannot
answer "did the parse succeed at the wrong thing" — and shlex, which implements
no shell expansion at all, resolves a word that carries one into a token bash
would never run. When such a word sits in VERB POSITION, the module returns a
clean parse naming an operation nobody asked for, and every gate searching for a
real operation finds none. :func:`_verb_unresolved` marks those segments, and
:func:`analyze_checked` reports the half of them whose cost was measured and
found affordable, so a verb the parser cannot ESTABLISH is treated as
unestablished rather than as absent. The other half, and the number that decided
it, are written out beside :data:`_BLIND_UNRESOLVED_VERB`.

    target is dropped from BOTH views. A target that can carry a command expansion (any
    ``$`` or backtick — ``2>$(rm x)``, ``2>"$(rm x)"``, ``2>$VAR``, backtick) is KEPT in
    ``raw`` (so ``_substitutions`` still sees the nested command a substitution redirect
    target EXECUTES) but EXCLUDED from ``argv_src`` — so it can no longer leak into argv
    and spoof ``git_subcommand``/``commit_skips_hooks`` (the push/commit fail-open this
    split closes). Process substitution ``<(…)``/``>(…)`` stays in BOTH (documented gap).
    ``raw`` stays byte-identical to the historical ``split_segments`` output for every
    ordinary command (the cwd/occurrence consumers match ``Segment.raw`` against a fresh
    re-split; locked by a golden test over a broad corpus). ONE intentional difference
    from the pre-#1455 scanner: a ``$(…)``/backtick target that contains an UNQUOTED
    control operator (``;`` ``&&`` ``||`` ``|``) is now paren-balanced into ONE segment
    instead of mis-split on that operator — which CLOSES an additional fail-open (HEAD
    mis-split ``git 2>$(a; b) push`` into ``git  $(a`` + ``b) push`` so ``git_subcommand``
    never saw the ``push``); the nested ``a``/``b`` still surface via ``_substitutions``.
    So ``raw`` is byte-identical EXCEPT it is strictly SAFER on this class — never the
    other direction (locked by the ``$(;)``/``$(&&)``/``$(|)`` cases in the redirect-argv
    test's EXPLOITS).

    or a command substitution ``$( … )`` / ``` `…` ``` (whose output is CAPTURED, not
    streamed to the swallowed background stdout — ``RESULT=$(cmd | filter)``) is NOT a
    background pipe. A bare subshell ``(cmd | x)`` DOES stream to the background stdout,
    so its ``|`` still counts. Used by the run_in_background guard: a piped background
    command's stdout is swallowed, so ONLY a genuine streamed pipe should block it.

    Residual (accepted for a CONVENIENCE guard — friction, not a sandbox): the quote
    model still mirrors ``split_segments``, so a quote that is backslash-escaped OUTSIDE
    quotes (``printf %s \\"foo | cat``), a stray quote char in a ``#`` comment or a
    ``<<EOF`` heredoc body, or a ``|`` in a ``case`` pattern can MISread — OVER-reading
    (``case`` ``|`` looks like a pipe) or UNDER-reading (a swallowed quote hides a later
    pipe). Never a security bypass either way (an over-read is a reworked command, an
    under-read re-exposes the empty-output footgun this guard usually prevents); closing
    these fully is the unbounded quote-parsing tail shared with ``split_segments``.

    ``count_substitutions`` inverts the ``$( … )`` rule, and exists because the two
    consumers need OPPOSITE answers about the same syntax. The background-output guard
    (default, ``False``) is right to skip them: ``RESULT=$(cmd | filter)`` captures its
    output, so nothing is swallowed. The pipe-STATUS guard needs ``True``: bash defines
    an assignment-only command's status as the status of the command substitution, so
    ``rc=$(prog | tail); echo $?`` reads the FILTER's status — exactly the footgun that
    guard exists to flag, and invisible while substitutions are skipped. Kept as one
    scanner with a flag rather than a second copy: two hand-rolled shell scanners drift,

    a ``cat <<'EOF'`` body line holding a plain gated git command resolves to a
    ``('git', <verb>)`` segment and is over-blocked with or without this decode.
    The decode makes the ANSI-C form CONSISTENT with that pre-existing plain-form

    never fail-open. Heredoc-awareness belongs in :func:`parse_segments` (where

    ``cat`` from an EXECUTING one like ``bash <<'EOF'``, whose body bash really

    This is the blind-spot signal a guard consults when it is about to conclude
    "no gated segment found". ``_argv`` degrades to a naive split on the SAME
    ``ValueError`` silently, so ``analyze()`` can never self-report that its
    result is untrustworthy: an ordinary quoting construct is enough to shift
    segmentation off and drop a real, executing command from the parse, and the
    return value looks identical to "there was nothing to find".

    Deliberately reads the WHOLE raw command, with no normalization of any kind.
    An earlier version pre-processed it to suppress prompts on a class of
    multi-line command, and that MEASURABLY disarmed the signal: on a shape a
    developer writes without thinking, the command really ran (verified against
    a shimmed binary, so the proof was execution rather than parse) while the
    pre-processed text tokenized cleanly and the guard fell silent. The
    triggering shape is deliberately not written down — this file is public and
    the guard it protects is load-bearing.

    KNOWN COST, stated rather than hidden: ``_argv`` DOES normalize before its
    own tokenize (it strips trailing comments), so this probe over-reports
    relative to the very parser whose blind spot it reports — an unquoted
    comment alone can make a benign command look unparseable. Stripping here is
    NOT the fix: measured over 19,246 real commands, doing so erases a mention
    of a gated operation in 3 of them, because a stripper's model of where a
    comment begins is not the shell's and the two disagree in both directions.
    A cure that can only raise severity, never clear it, is tracked separately.

    That rule is now literal. An earlier revision folded ``\\<newline>`` to a
    SPACE before probing, which contradicted the paragraph above and was also
    simply wrong about bash — bash REMOVES a line continuation, joining the two
    halves into one word (``ec\\<newline>ho`` runs ``echo``), so replacing it
    with a space produced the reading furthest from what actually executes.
    MEASURED over 12,099 real commands: folding and not folding classify
    IDENTICALLY (339 un-tokenizable either way, zero commands differ), so the
    normalization bought nothing and is removed rather than documented.

    ANSI-C ``$'...'`` is handled in the analyze path, NOT here. shlex SUCCEEDS on
    ``$'push'`` but leaves the ``$`` (a token one char off from what bash runs),
    so :func:`_decode_escape_free_ansi_c` rewrites the escape-free case to what
    bash produces BEFORE tokenizing — the verb/flag then resolves normally and
    the ordinary gate fires. This function is deliberately NOT broadened to flag
    ANSI-C, because a benign ``$'...'`` in a MESSAGE argument
    (``git commit -m $'l1\\nl2'``) is legitimate and flagging it would over-ask;
    distinguishing verb-position from argument-position is exactly what the
    per-segment analyze path can do and a whole-command probe cannot. The one
    residual — a HEX-encoded verb (``$'\\x70\\x75\\x73\\x68'``), which the
    escape-free decode does not touch — is tracked separately rather than closed
    here with a message-hostile broadening.

# Reserved words the segmenter does not model. CLOSED SET, and that is the whole
# reason this list is safe where a list of command CARRIERS would not be: the
# shell grammar fixes its reserved words, while the set of programs that take a
# command as an argument grows forever. Enumerating the first converges;
# enumerating the second is a race. Only words MEASURED to leave `analyze()`
# without the inner command are here — `if`/`while`/`for`/`select` and the
# grouping operators all resolve correctly and are deliberately absent, because
# every entry costs a fallback to coarse matching.

# WHY THIS MODULE HAS COST BOUNDS AT ALL
#
# Every guard is a hook registered with a wall clock (10s for the destructive and
# protected-path guards, 60s for the push guard). The official hook contract is
# explicit that a timed-out hook "doesn't block the tool call … don't count on a
# stalled hook to act as a gate". A guard that runs out of clock does not refuse — it
# PERMITS. So cost on this path is a correctness property, not a performance one.
#
# Cost has TWO independent axes and each needs its own bound, because neither
# subsumes the other. MEASURED, this parser, on `echo` + a pad:
#
#     one long token   65K 0.30s | 250K 2.65s | 450K 9.14s   (0.46 -> 2.03 s/100K)
#     many small tokens 65K 0.12s | 250K 0.48s | 450K 0.87s   (flat 0.19 s/100K)
#
# So cost is SUPERLINEAR in the length of a single token, and a 450K command with NO
# nesting at all costs 9.14s against a 10s registration. That cost is spent in the
# FIRST pass, before any recursion — which is why a budget checked between recursion
# levels cannot bound it, and why an earlier draft that tried to was abandoned.

#: The largest command this module will read. Bounds the unavoidable first pass.
#:
#: Calibrated against the TIGHTEST real path, which is not the one the individual
#: guards are registered on. `bash_safety_hook.sh` is registered at **5 seconds** and
#: delegates to `destructive_command_guard` AND `protected_paths_guard` SEQUENTIALLY,
#: so two full parses of the same command share a 5s budget. Sizing against a single
#: guard's 10s registration would have been calibrating against the loosest path and
#: calling it a margin.
#:
#: THIS CAP AND :data:`MAX_SUBSTITUTION_DEPTH` ARE CHOSEN TOGETHER, and neither
#: number means anything alone. The parser re-scans the remaining text at every level,
#: so the worst case an attacker can force is a command at exactly this cap nested to
#: exactly that bound — cost is length x levels. Measuring length at depth 0 and
#: calling it the cost curve is the specific mistake that produced a 64 KiB cap here,
#: which measured 0.86s at depth 0 and 5.46s at depth 8: OVER the 5s budget, i.e. the
#: fail-open this module exists to close, reintroduced by its own fix.
#:
#: AND THE DIVISOR IS FIVE PARSES, NOT TWO. `bash_safety_hook.sh` delegates to THREE
#: guards over the same command (destructive_command_guard, protected_paths_guard,
#: git_discard_guard), and git_discard_guard reaches three consumers that each analyse
#: it. An earlier revision of this comment claimed "two guards, two parses" and sized
#: the cap against that; MEASURED end to end, the pair it chose ran 6.12s against a 5s
#: registration. Two of those three duplicate parses are now memoised away
#: (`git_discard_guard._parse_once`), because bounding the INPUT does not help if the
#: same work is done three times.
#:
#: MEASURED end to end through the real hook — worst payload INSIDE both bounds (so
#: nothing short-circuits), ALLOWED by every guard (so nothing exits early), and
#: naming rm AND clean AND recurse so every delegation arm runs. Cap fixed at 48 KiB,
#: which is the floor set by the longest real command:
#:
#:     depth 6   3.08s   62% of budget   1.6x margin
#:     depth 5   2.67s   53%             1.9x margin   <- chosen
#:     depth 4   2.52s   50%             2.0x margin
#:
#: THIS TABLE IS THE ONLY PLACE THESE FIGURES ARE DERIVED. Two other files and a test
#: docstring used to restate the depth-5 row from memory, as 2.92s and 3.19s, so one
#: measurement appeared with three values and nothing said which was current — they
#: now point here instead. The reason a copy drifts is that the figure is
#: load-dependent: re-measured 2026-09-08 through the same path on a box under heavy
#: concurrent load, the depth-5 row came out at a 2.84s median over three runs with a
#: 2.80-3.25s spread, which is the same decision and a different number. Treat the row
#: as the scale at which the bound was chosen, and RE-MEASURE before quoting it as a
#: current fact.
#:
#: Depth 4 buys almost no time for meaningfully less headroom, so 5 is the balance:
#: 1.9x on the clock and 1.25x over the deepest nesting any real command reaches. That
#: second ratio read 1.67x, from a corpus whose deepest command was 3; the re-derivation
#: below finds one at 4, and a margin term is quoted against the DEEPEST observation
#: available, never the friendliest. Nothing reaches 5 in either corpus, so the bound
#: itself does not move — only the honesty of the margin does.
#: The asymmetry decides which side to buy margin on — exceeding a bound fails CLOSED
#: (a refusal), while exceeding the hook timeout fails OPEN (the command runs
#: unchecked), so the clock is the side that must not be shaved.
#:
#: Headroom: over 45,956 distinct real Bash commands from this install's history the
#: longest is 43,480 chars, so the cap is 1.13x that and fires on 0 of them. The cap
#: CANNOT go lower without refusing real work, which is why depth carries the tuning.
#:
#: THAT MAXIMUM IS METHOD-UNRECORDED and is deliberately no longer labelled MEASURED.
#: The re-derivation below, which DOES carry its method, finds a longest of 40,925 over
#: a corpus 2.65x larger — and a superset harvested the same way cannot have a smaller
#: maximum, so the two harvests are not the same population and 43,480 cannot be
#: re-checked from anything written down. It is kept rather than replaced because it is
#: the LARGER of the two, and every claim resting on it (the cap clears the longest real
#: command; the fixtures assert `longest_real < cap`) is the more conservative for using
#: it. The ratio is what the choice costs: 1.13x against 43,480, 1.20x against 40,925.
#: Quote whichever you can defend, and never present the unrecorded one as measured.
#:
#: RE-DERIVED 2026-09-08 with the method stated, because a denominator whose method is
#: not recorded cannot be checked — and this one could not be: two harvests taken in
#: the same session left 45,956 and 45,358 side by side in these files with nothing to
#: arbitrate them. Method: every `Bash` tool_use `input.command` in this install's CC
#: transcripts (`~/.claude/projects` and `~/.genesis/background-sessions`, 11,298
#: `.jsonl` files), deduplicated by exact string. That yields 121,927 distinct
#: commands, longest 40,925 chars: 0 above this cap, 9 above the old 32,768 one, and a
#: `Segment.depth` distribution of 91.4% / 7.9% / 0.7% / 16 commands / 1 command at
#: depths 0-4. Exactly one command in the whole corpus trips a bound, and it is a probe
#: typed while writing this note. So both bounds still fire on 0 real work at 2.65x the
#: denominator they were chosen on.
#:
#: READ THAT AS A SECOND OPINION, NOT AS A CORRECTION, because the two are not nested:
#: this harvest has 2.65x the COUNT and a SHORTER longest command (40,925 vs 43,480).
#: A corpus that merely grew could not do that, so the harvests differ in what they
#: admit, not only in when they were taken — which is the whole argument for recording
#: a method beside a denominator. Neither number is wrong; they are different
#: populations, and the cap sits above the longest command in BOTH.
#:
#: THIS CAP WAS 32,768 AND THAT WAS TOO SMALL — recorded because the mistake is
#: instructive rather than embarrassing. It was sized against an earlier corpus of
#: 20,514 commands whose longest was 14,682 chars, whence a claimed "2.2x headroom
#: and 0 fires". The full corpus is 2.2x larger and contains three commands ABOVE
#: 32,768 — all of them `cat > … <<EOF` here-docs writing review prose, a shape this
#: very workflow generates and the earlier corpus had simply not accumulated yet. A
#: cap is only as good as the corpus it was sized against, and a corpus keeps growing
#: after you measure it. The length headroom here is deliberately modest (1.13x)
#: because exceeding this bound ASKS rather than refuses — see _BLIND_OVER_LONG.
MAX_COMMAND_CHARS = 49_152

#: How deep :func:`analyze` will follow nested scripts and command substitutions.
#:
#: The second axis. The parser re-runs its whole scanner battery on near-identical
#: text at every level, so a command inside the length cap still multiplies by its
#: nesting depth — the cap alone leaves that unbounded, exactly as the depth bound
#: alone leaves the first pass unbounded. MEASURED end to end against the real
#: ``protected_paths_guard``, on a payload it genuinely refuses (a protected data
#: directory) padded with a quoted string to 65,400 chars, under its 10s timeout:
#:
#:     depth   0  exit 2 refused   0.46s
#:     depth  32  exit 2 refused   6.78s
#:     depth  48  exit 2 refused   9.96s
#:     depth 128  KILLED at 10s -> non-2 -> the tool call PROCEEDS
#:
#: With the bound the same payloads are flat at 2.0-2.1s and refused at every depth.
#: (Padding SHAPE moves these by 3.4x, so a depth quoted without a length AND a shape
#: is not a measurement.)
#:
#: 5 is chosen from data, not taste, and JOINTLY with :data:`MAX_COMMAND_CHARS` — see
#: the cost table there, because cost is length x levels and neither limit can be set
#: without the other. MEASURED over 45,956 distinct real commands, counting the depth
#: ``analyze`` ACTUALLY recurses to (``Segment.depth``, so ``bash -c`` wrappers and
#: substitutions both): 87.5% reach depth 0, 11.7% depth 1, 0.79% depth 2, and 7
#: commands reach depth 3. Nothing reaches 5. Re-derived 2026-09-08 over the larger
#: corpus recorded with :data:`MAX_COMMAND_CHARS`: 91.4% / 7.9% / 0.7%, 16 commands at
#: depth 3 and ONE at depth 4. Still nothing at 5, which is the clause the bound rests
#: on — but the deepest real command is 4 rather than 3, so quote the margin as 1.25x.
#:
#: This was 8, and came down twice: once when the cap went up, and again when the
#: end-to-end budget turned out to carry FIVE parses rather than two. The cap cannot
#: move (it is pinned above the longest real command), so this bound is the only
#: tuning lever left — see the measured table in MAX_COMMAND_CHARS.
#:
#: Note the units — this bound counts ``Segment.depth``, NOT how deep a command looks,
#: and the two differ per syntax because ``bash -c "$(…)"`` descends twice per level
#: while a bare ``$(…)`` descends once. MEASURED at this bound, the first nesting
#: level that reports over_nested:
#:
#:     bash -c "$(…)" x N   ->  N = 4
#:     $(…) x N             ->  N = 6
#:
#: (An earlier revision of this comment asserted 3, which was simply wrong — measure
#: it rather than deriving it from "twice per level", since the descent is not the
#: only thing that consumes a level.) Compare the bound against the measured
#: ``Segment.depth`` distribution above, never against an eyeballed nesting level.

class BlindSpot(NamedTuple):
    """A reason this module cannot see everything a command would execute.

    ``cause`` is the phrase a guard drops into "this command <cause> and mentions
    …"; ``hint`` is the way OUT, which differs per cause and is the half that makes
    a refusal actionable rather than a wall. Guards supply their own op-specific
    framing around both — what counts as gated is theirs to say, why the parse is
    blind is ours.

    THE POLICY LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE CONSUMERS. The one remaining DECISION field (of
    the three fields below) is a verdict this module has already made, so a guard obeys
    a single boolean instead of re-deriving one from a string:

    ``bounds_induced`` — a BOUND stopped this parse, as opposed to the pre-existing
    ``untokenizable`` case. "Blind" is not one thing: every guard's behaviour for an
    untokenizable command was already settled before the bounds existed, so a guard
    restoring what a bound took away must act on ``bounds_induced`` only. Widening to
    all three causes is a new over-block wearing the costume of a regression fix, and
    it was MEASURED as one: 209 of 1,367 real clean-mentioning commands and 161 of
    3,222 pytest-mentioning ones.

    THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO PER-AXIS SEVERITY FIELD. One existed briefly — a
    ``refuse`` flag letting the length bound ask where the depth bound refused — and
    removing it is the whole lesson of this design. It was wired into guards whose
    only verdicts are BLOCK and ALLOW, where "don't refuse" does not mean "ask", it
    means PERMIT: MEASURED, a real ``git clean -fd`` and a real
    ``git checkout --recurse-submodules .``, each padded past the length cap, went
    BLOCK -> ALLOW through both the guard and the shell hook — the first being the
    operation that guard's own header calls unrecoverable.

    That flag cost two review rounds and produced a fail-open in the very change meant
    to close fail-opens, and its entire benefit was hypothetical: it protected a long
    here-doc that MEASURES at 0 of 45,956 real commands. A distinction that no real
    input exercises, which every one of six call sites must choose correctly, and
    whose wrong choice is silent, is a defect generator rather than a feature. So the
    module answers exactly ONE question, the same way for everyone: was this parse cut
    short by a bound? A consumer that fails closed does so on that alone, and cannot
    pick the wrong axis because there is no axis to pick.

    THERE IS NO ``kind`` FIELD, deliberately. It was a string discriminator that
    consumers compared as ``kind != "untokenizable"``, and that comparison silently
    failed OPEN in two ways at once: it could not express "a bound fired AND
    tokenization failed", and a consumer that forgot it kept the old behaviour with
    no signal. Removing it makes every stale comparison an AttributeError at test
    time — loud, at the one moment a silent fail-open is affordable to catch.

    AND :data:`_BLIND_UNRESOLVED_VERB` DID NOT GET ONE EITHER. It looked as though
    it needed a field: one guard must treat that cause differently, because its
    engage-test is the operation's NAME in the raw text and this is the one cause
    that removes the name. A field here would have made every consumer choose
    again, silently, which is the generator this class already paid for once. The
    fact lives on :attr:`Segment.verb_unresolved` instead, and the guard that needs
    it reads that against its OWN list of gated programs. Which programs are gated
    is the guard's to say; why the parse is blind is ours.

def over_nested(command: str) -> bool:
    """True when :func:`analyze` stopped descending before it ran out of command.

    The companion to :func:`untokenizable`, and it exists for the identical reason:
    ``analyze`` cannot otherwise report its own blind spot. A truncated parse and a
    clean one are indistinguishable in its return value, so a caller that reads "no
    gated segment found" as "no gated command present" fails OPEN — here by
    concluding a deeply-buried ``rm`` is not there, when the parser simply stopped
    looking.

    Bounding the recursion WITHOUT this signal would trade one fail-open for a worse
    one: today an over-deep command runs the guard out of clock, which is at least
    loud; a silent cap would have it return a confident, wrong all-clear.

    THE ANSWER COMES FROM THE PARSE ITSELF, never from a second opinion about it. An
    earlier revision of this function was a hand-written depth counter that predicted
    what ``analyze`` would do — and two shapes DEFEATED it, both measured: parens
    inside a double-quoted string, and ``$(( … ))`` arithmetic, each of which
    depressed the counter below the real depth while ``analyze`` truncated anyway. A
    hidden ``rm -rf`` was then invisible to the parse AND unreported by the probe,
    which is precisely the silent all-clear this signal exists to prevent. Two
    parsers means two answers, and the gap between them is the vulnerability; see
    :func:`_analyze_bounded`, which is the only thing that can answer this exactly.

    Reports the DEPTH bound specifically. A command refused for LENGTH is a different
    blind spot with a different remedy; ask :func:`analyze_checked` for either.
    """
    return _analyze_bounded(command)[1] == "depth"


def analyze_checked(command: str) -> tuple[list[Segment], BlindSpot | None]:
    """:func:`analyze`, plus the single question a guard must ask: am I blind here?

    Returns ``(segments, blind_spot)``. ``blind_spot`` is None when neither of the
    blind spots this module CAN detect fired, and otherwise says which did, in the two
    halves a guard needs to write a message.

    That is deliberately weaker than "the parse was complete", and the difference
    matters because five guards now hang their fail-closed decision on it. MEASURED,
    each returning no ``rm`` segment AND ``blind_spot`` None: ``eval "rm -rf …"``,
    process substitution ``cat <(rm -rf …)``, and ``env -S 'rm -rf …'``. Those forms
    are not parsed and cannot be reported — the module does not know it missed them.
    Pre-existing, documented at :func:`_substitutions`, and not a promise this
    function can make.

    ONE call for every consumer that fails closed on an unreadable command — not one
    call per probe. A blind spot discovered later is then wired in HERE, once, rather
    than in each guard that has to remember it; "every call site must remember" is
    the shape that has repeatedly shipped guards importing a probe they never
    consult. It is also strictly CHEAPER than what the guards did before: one parse,
    where they previously ran a separate tokenize probe and then parsed anyway.

    A BOUNDED PARSE RETURNS NO SEGMENTS. Not the ones it managed to reach — none.
    This is the single most load-bearing line in the module, so it gets the reason:
    a partial segment list is "found something AND stopped looking", and every guard
    here decides by SEARCHING that list, treating "not found" as "not present". A
    partial list therefore turns a bound into a fail-open at an index the author of
    the command chooses. MEASURED, base vs a version that returned partial segments:

        git commit -m ok && <9-deep git commit --no-verify>   BLOCK -> ALLOW
        git push origin feature && <9-deep git push +main>    BLOCK -> ask

    Both are decoys — one visible benign operation filling the list so the not-found
    branch, where the blind-spot net lives, is never reached. Returning nothing makes
    "not found" trustworthy again, which is what every consumer already assumed, and
    fixes both without a line of per-consumer logic. The length bound always worked
    this way ("a prefix of a shell command is not a partial answer"); the depth bound
    did not, and the whole defect class lived in that inconsistency.

    Order is deliberate, and it is NOT the order this function first shipped with.
    Both bounds outrank :func:`untokenizable`, because a consumer restoring what a
    bound took away asks ``bounds_induced`` — so reporting the untokenizable cause for
    a command that is ALSO over a bound hands that consumer the one answer it is
    documented to ignore. MEASURED: appending a trailing ``# don't`` to a nested
    command flipped three guards from BLOCK to ALLOW, because an apostrophe in a
    comment is valid shell that shlex cannot tokenize. Reversing the order costs
    2 of 45,956 real commands a reclassification and no change of verdict.

    :data:`_BLIND_UNRESOLVED_VERB` is reported LAST, which means it is reported only
    where this function previously returned None. That is a property worth stating
    rather than a rank: every command that already had a blind spot keeps the exact
    cause and hint it had, so the rule can only add net coverage and can never
    reword or re-rank an existing refusal. It also makes the change measurable — the
    flips it causes are exactly the commands moving from "clean parse" to "blind",
    with nothing else shifting underneath them.

    command, and peel the matching subshell-close `)` off the revealed argv.

    Command-position tokens (`then`/`do`/`!`/`(`/`{` …) can wrap a command inside
    a control structure or subshell; a leading `(` may be GLUED to the command
    (`(git`). Reserved words are stripped UNCONDITIONALLY at the front so the real
    command is revealed through any control wrapper (`time ! git push`,
    `if git push; then …`, `until git push; do …` all resolve to `git push`). A
    leading `(` may nest (`( (cmd) )` spaced); its matching trailing `)` closers
    (as many as `(` openers consumed) are peeled off the operand(s) carrying the
    close.

    Accepted SAFE-DIRECTION residual: a reserved word that is genuinely a command
    NAME rather than a control keyword (`command if git push` — `command` runs an
    executable literally named `if`) is still stripped, so analyze() over-resolves
    to `git push` and the push gate fires on a push bash would not actually run.
    That is an OVER-gate (a spurious block of an exotic, near-never-typed form),
    never a MISS — the monotonic-safe direction. Modelling wrapper-vs-keyword
    precisely was tried (round-2 `wrapper_consumed`) and REMOVED: it turned the
    over-gate into a real false-negative (`time ! git push` → exe `!` → push gate
    MISS), which is the unsafe direction. #1457 round-3.

    Redirection syntax is deliberately NOT touched here: this resolver feeds
    flag/value parsers (`git_subcommand`, `gh_pr_subcommand`, `commit_skips_hooks`)
    and dropping a token would shift positions and let a value-flag swallow the
    real gated token (a fail-closed-gate bypass — #1457 round-2). A consumer that
    reads POSITIONALS skips redirections LOCALLY, inside its own walk and AFTER its
    own flag/value handling (full_suite_guard, protected_paths, destructive each do)
    — never as a pre-pass, which would recreate the same desync.

    Safe-direction / MONOTONIC for security: the arithmetic, command-position and
    `(` branches fire ONLY when argv[0] is `((`-prefixed / a control token /
    `(`-prefixed, so a normal command (argv[0] ∈ {git, gh, rm, …}) resolves to the
    same exe and the same argv and is returned byte-for-byte unchanged — the strip
    can REVEAL a hidden command but never hide a caught one. `((…))` is bash
    ARITHMETIC evaluation, which runs NO external command, so its outer segment

#: Characters that make a shell WORD mean something other than what it spells.
#: shlex implements quote removal and backslash escapes faithfully and implements
#: NO expansion whatsoever, so a word carrying one of these tokenizes CLEANLY into
#: a token that is not the word bash finally runs. That is the whole shape of the
#: problem this module cannot otherwise see: :func:`untokenizable` answers "did the
#: parse fail", and here the parse SUCCEEDS while resolving something else.
#:
#: An ALLOWLIST over SUBSTITUTION, deliberately, and scoped in that word because
#: the scope is the part that keeps being overstated. These two characters open a
#: substitution in bash's word grammar — parameter, command, arithmetic, and every
#: quoting form layered over them — so a word free of both is a word shlex and bash
#: agree on AS FAR AS SUBSTITUTION GOES. Enumerating spellings instead (which
#: quoting form, which encoding) would be a denylist, and a denylist on a safety
#: boundary is a treadmill whose every miss is a hole.
#:
#: THIS IS NOT THE COMPLETE SET OF WORD-GENERATING CONSTRUCTS, and saying otherwise
#: is the specific mistake this file keeps repeating. #1686's docstring called a
#: hex-encoded verb "the one residual" and was already wrong when written. An
#: earlier revision of THIS comment claimed the two characters covered the class
#: and was falsified in review by BRACE expansion, which generates words without
#: either of them. A LATER revision then listed brace expansion as COVERED without
#: qualification, and was falsified the same way: it is covered in VERB POSITION,
#: and a brace group in an option's VALUE slot is a different, open case. Twice is
#: a pattern, so the columns below name a POSITION as well as a construct.
#:
#:   COVERED  substitution        in verb position, via these two characters
#:   COVERED  brace expansion     in verb position, via :func:`_has_brace_expansion`
#:                                — ``{a,b}``, ``{a..b}``
#:   LEFT     ANY expansion in a  A value-taking option's value is skipped unread
#:            VALUE slot          (see :func:`_verb_unresolved`), in BOTH the split
#:            (either option      (``-C <v>``) and attached (``--git-dir=<v>``)
#:             form)              forms — they are one command to bash and answer
#:                                the same here. So an expansion there can INJECT a
#:                                verb the parse never sees, with argv intact.
#:                                PRE-EXISTING and not

#:                                commands, flagging a non-literal value slot fires on
#:                                711 of them (0.55%, 0.44% of invocations), against
#:                                15 for everything this module currently moves. The
#:                                dominant shape is ``git -C $WT`` on a worktree path,
#:                                which is ordinary work here, so closing it would
#:                                trade a 47x over-block for a residual nothing in the
#:                                corpus exercises. `_word_continues` covers only the
#:                                narrow sub-case where the value is the unterminated
#:                                HEAD of a split word.
#:                                RE-MEASURED from the GRAMMAR rather than the corpus
#:                                after a corpus null result was wrong three times:

#:                                construct x position, each evaluated under four
#:                                environments so a slot that CAN move the verb is
#:                                identified by watching it move rather than by
#:                                argument. This slot moves; every other new refusal
#:                                sits on a slot that also moves.
#:   LEFT     tilde expansion     applies only at the start of a word and only up to
#:                                the first ``/``, which is strictly ahead of the
#:                                basename :func:`_basename` reads. ``~/venv/bin/python``
#:                                is ``python`` under every value of HOME, so flagging
#:                                it would cost the common shape and buy nothing.
#:   LEFT     pathname expansion  (``*?[``) a REAL residual, not a safe one. A glob
#:                                resolves against FILENAMES, so ``git pu*`` becomes a
#:                                verb only if a file of that name already exists in the
#:                                working directory, and otherwise stays the literal word
#:                                git rejects. Closing it means flagging every ordinary
#:                                ``ls *.py``-shaped word in verb position for a hazard
#:                                that also needs a planted file.
#:
#:   LEFT     a QUOTED or        `shlex` removes quotes before this check runs, so
#:            ESCAPED verb word  ``git '$ACTION'`` and ``git pu\\{s,s\\}h`` are
#:                               flagged although bash leaves both literal
#:                               (VERIFIED through an argv-printing shim). An
#:                               over-block, so the direction is safe.

#:                               exactly ONE is flagged on a quoted word — and that
#:                               one is ``gh pr "$M" --help``, which the row below
#:                               already covers. Closing it needs the RAW quoting to
#:                               survive into this check, and neither cheap route is
#:                               sound: an INDEX into the raw tokens does not survive

#:                               OPEN — in ``git $ACTION '$ACTION'`` the quoted twin
#:                               would clear the active one. A structural change to
#:                               this pipeline is not worth 1 in 69,259; a fail-open
#:                               shortcut is not worth anything.
#:   LEFT     a TERMINAL mode    ``git --help <topic>``, ``git --html-path`` and
#:            (help / path)      ``gh --help pr <verb>`` cannot run an operation, but
#:                               the walk below treats every option as something to
#:                               skip and reaches the non-literal word after them, so
#:                               a help query on a shell-built topic is refused.
#:                               An over-block, and the only one here whose closure
#:                               would be an OPEN SET: it needs a list of every git
#:                               and gh mode that consumes the remaining words as
#:                               documentation, which grows whenever those tools do.
#:                               This module has already paid for enumerating another

#:                               and the price of the residual is one refused help
#:                               command against a list nobody can finish.

#:                               ``/bin/sh`` is dash: ``pus{h..h}`` expands to
#:                               ``push`` under bash and stays LITERAL under dash, so
#:                               ``dash -c 'git pus{h..h} || echo fallback'`` has its

    * **git** — accepts options this module has never heard of, and 726 of the
      750 candidates its own strings table yields are rejected while a handful
      consume a value. Three such options (``--config-env``, ``--attr-source``,
      ``--shallow-file``) each let a LITERAL force-publish past this guard
      before they were listed. Closed world.
    * **gh** — ``gh --bogus-flag x pr view 1`` exits 1 with "unknown flag" and
      runs nothing, so an unlisted gh option cannot hide a verb; gh's parser
      closes the open set for us. Open world, and making it closed would be pure
      over-block with no hazard behind it.

    ``glued_value_shorts`` is likewise measured, and the two disagree:
    ``gh -Rcli/cli pr view 1`` exits 0, while ``git -C/tmp/x rev-parse`` and

def _has_brace_expansion(token: str) -> bool:
    """Whether *token* carries a bash BRACE EXPANSION — ``{a,b}`` or ``{a..b}``.

    Brace expansion generates words with no substitution character anywhere, so it
    is invisible to :data:`_EXPANSION_MARKS` and needed its own check. shlex keeps
    the braces verbatim, which is one more way a token can tokenize cleanly into
    something bash never runs.

    A brace group expands only when its top level holds a COMMA or a ``..`` range —
    ``{a}`` and ``{}`` are literal to bash, and treating them as expansion would
    flag ordinary text. Nesting is tracked so the comma of an INNER group does not
    make an outer literal group look expandable, matching bash, which expands
    ``{{a,b}}`` via the inner group.

    THE RANGE FORM IS WHY THIS IS A RULE AND NOT A FOOTNOTE. A comma list always
    emits at least two words, so it lands an extra argument next to the verb and
    corrupts the rest of argv — real, but self-limiting. A range with identical
    endpoints emits exactly ONE word: ``pus{h..h}`` is a single ``push``, argv
    intact. VERIFIED against bash itself through a shim that prints its own argv,
    rather than reasoned about — the two forms look alike and behave differently,
    and the difference is the whole severity of the case.

    ONE LEFT-TO-RIGHT PASS, and that is a security property rather than a matter of
    taste. The first version of this scan restarted an inner walk at every ``{``,
    so a token of unterminated openers cost O(n^2): MEASURED on this function,
    0.014s at 500 characters, 5.5s at 8,000, and 173s at
    :data:`MAX_COMMAND_CHARS` — against guards registered with a 10-second wall
    clock. The hook contract is explicit that a timed-out hook does not block the
    tool call, so a guard that runs out of clock PERMITS, and this module feeds
    nine of them: one crafted word would have disengaged the lot. A stack of
    per-group flags answers the same question without ever re-reading a character,
    because a ``{`` already passed can only ever be the group the next ``}``
    closes.

    The stack entry is that group's own "saw a top-level comma or range" flag, so
    the innermost open group is the one a separator belongs to — which is exactly
    the nesting rule above, expressed without a second traversal.

    to shlex, which splits on that space like any other. Every position after it is
    then off by however many tokens the substitution contributed — so a walk that
    counts positions is reading a different word than bash will.

    This matters at exactly one place: the token a value-taking option consumes.
    Everywhere else the walk already inspects the token itself, and a partial
    substitution carries the ``$`` or the backtick that :func:`_word_is_literal`
    catches. The consumed value is the one token skipped unread — and skipping the
    HEAD of a split word leaves the walk pointing at that word's TAIL, which can be
    an ordinary-looking literal with the real verb sitting behind it.

    Detects an unterminated ``$(`` and an odd backtick count. Deliberately ignores
    parentheses NOT opened by ``$`` — ``--format=%(refname)`` is data, and treating

    WHAT IT CLOSES, stated narrowly because a wider claim was wrong. It closes the

    more. It does NOT close "the position-shift case" in general, which an earlier
    revision of this docstring claimed: a value that is a plain ``$VAR`` or a brace
    group is a single, terminated token, so neither test here fires, and the walk
    skips it and runs out of words. A value that EXPANDS to several words then
    injects a verb the parse never sees at all. That is the LEFT-column entry beside
    :data:`_EXPANSION_MARKS`, it is PRE-EXISTING rather than introduced here, and the
    711-command price of closing it is recorded there.

    Zero added flags is therefore not evidence of coverage. It is what a narrow test

def _verb_unresolved(argv: list[str]) -> bool:
    """Whether this argv's VERB — the words that decide WHICH operation runs —
    cannot be established by the parse.

    TWO CAUSES, and they are not the same kind of fact. The first is a shell
    expansion standing where a verb-deciding word should be: the text is not
    there to read. The second is an option this module cannot CLASSIFY on a
    dispatcher whose world is closed (:attr:`_DispatcherSpec.closed_world`) —
    the text is perfectly readable, and the parse still cannot say which word is
    the verb, because an unlisted option that consumes a value puts that VALUE
    in the verb slot.

    The second cause is the inversion this function exists to carry. Before it,
    an unlisted ``-``-prefixed token was stepped over alone, so the walk
    answered CONFIDENTLY and WRONGLY: ``git --future-opt somevalue push --force``
    resolved its verb to ``somevalue``, every gate keyed on ``push`` stood down,
    and nothing reported a difficulty. Three real options behaved exactly that
    way on this guard. Now an unclassified option is reported here, the same way
    an unreadable one is, and the callers that already refuse an unresolved verb
    refuse it — failing closed and visibly instead of open and silently.

    Two positions qualify for the expansion cause, and only these two:

    * the executable's BASENAME. Only the basename, because that is what
      :func:`_basename` reads and what a gate compares: ``$HOME/bin/git`` and
      ``~/venv/bin/python`` resolve to ``git`` and ``python`` no matter what the
      leading component expands to, so flagging them would be a pure over-block
      with no hazard behind it. ``/usr/bin/$X`` does NOT resolve, and is flagged.
    * for a multi-verb dispatcher, the words that select the subcommand — plus any
      option word passed on the way to it, because an unreadable option can shift
      which word lands in the verb slot, and plus the VALUE of a value-taking
      option when that value is only the head of a split word (see
      :func:`_word_continues`), for the same reason one step removed.

    An ARGUMENT is deliberately out of scope. ``git commit -m "$msg"``,
    ``rm "$f"``, ``echo $PATH`` are ordinary work; a gate that asked about every
    variable in every argument would be turned off within a week, and the failure
    this closes is specifically that the OPERATION is unestablished while the
    parse reports success. What an unresolved argument costs a path or flag gate
    is a different question with a different answer, and is not answered here.

def git_subcommand_index(argv: list[str]) -> int | None:
    """Index of the git subcommand token in ``argv``, or None.

    Exposed alongside :func:`git_subcommand` because a caller that needs the
    OPERANDS after the subcommand cannot recover this index on its own.
    ``argv.index(name)`` returns the FIRST token equal to the name, and a global
    option's operand may equal the subcommand's own name — ``git -C worktree worktree
    remove /tmp/x`` selects the ``-C`` operand, so the operand list starts one
    token early, the removal is not recognised, and the guard falls OPEN. Found
    by cross-model review, 2026-09-03.

    The alternative was for the caller to repeat the option-skipping loop below.
    That is replica drift: two copies of one rule, diverging silently the next
    time the option table grows. One scan, one source of truth.

    THIS WALK IS DELIBERATELY NOT CLOSED-WORLD, and the asymmetry with
    :func:`_verb_unresolved` is the load-bearing decision in this change.

    An earlier revision of it returned None for an option the module cannot
    classify — the honest answer to "which word is the verb". It was WRONG to
    ship, because None already means something else to every caller. Twenty-four
    call sites across five guards read "not the subcommand I gate" as "not my
    concern", so widening None widened the set of commands each guard ignores.
    MEASURED on that revision, against the same guards on merged main:
    ``git --bare worktree remove <path>`` went BLOCK -> allow in
    worktree_cwd_guard, and ``commit_skips_hooks`` flipped True -> False for a
    ``--no-verify`` behind any unclassified global — a fail-open introduced by a
    change whose entire purpose is to close one.

    So the inversion lives on :attr:`Segment.verb_unresolved`, which is a
    channel whose only meaning is "cannot tell" and which the callers that fail
    closed already consult. This function keeps main's best-effort answer: for
    an unlisted consumer it can still name the option's VALUE as the verb, which
    is the pre-existing residual, unchanged here and NOT closed by this change.
    Closing it means teaching each guard to consult the blind spot, which is
    per-guard work on five enforcement hooks and belongs in its own change.

    Read together: ask :func:`_verb_unresolved` whether the verb can be trusted;
    ask this for what it is. A caller that acts on the answer without asking the
    first question is exactly as exposed as it was before this change — no more,
    and for the push guard, which does ask, considerably less.
