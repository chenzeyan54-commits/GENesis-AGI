"""Review state tracker — manages review markers for enforcement hooks.

Used by:
- review_enforcement_prompt.py (UserPromptSubmit hook)
- review_enforcement_commit.py (PreToolUse hook)
- genesis_stop_hook.py (Stop hook)
- Claude (after /review + code-reviewer agent complete)

The marker file records a hash of ``git diff --cached --raw --no-abbrev -z`` (staged
changes only) at the time review was done.  If staged content changes, the marker
becomes stale and review is required again.  Unstaged working-tree edits
(e.g. from Codex) do not trigger review enforcement.

Review evidence: the authoritative signal is the code-reviewer agent output. It
defaults to a PER-WORKTREE path (``review_state.py evidence-path``) so concurrent
sessions don't overwrite each other's audit; ``--agent-output`` overrides it. gstack
skill-usage telemetry, when present, is recorded as advisory corroboration but never
gates marking — it is not installed on many hosts.

CLI usage:
    python3 review_state.py status         # prints current review state
    python3 review_state.py evidence-path  # prints this worktree's evidence path
    python3 review_state.py mark           # an internal (same-model) review — never counts
    python3 review_state.py mark --agent-output <path>                        # internal, explicit path
    python3 review_state.py mark --source external --defects                  # external defect-bearing round → +1
    python3 review_state.py mark --source external --clean                    # external clean round → reset streak
    python3 review_state.py diff-hash      # prints current diff hash

THE ESCALATION STREAK IS CROSS-MODEL ONLY. ``--source`` records WHO PRODUCED THE
FINDINGS the mark represents, and it is what decides whether the round counts:
  * ``--source internal`` (the DEFAULT) — a genesis-architect / genesis-security /
    any-subagent / self review. Same author-model reviewing its own work: it is free,
    shares the author's blind spots, and NEVER moves the streak (not an increment, not
    a reset), whatever its outcome. The outcome flag is optional and ignored here.
  * ``--source external`` — a review by a non-ANTHROPIC MODEL found (or cleared) the round.
    EXTERNAL is judged by the reviewing MODEL, not the gateway: Anthropic Claude via any
    route (incl. an OpenRouter Claude route) is INTERNAL, and a Genesis internal model call
    is never a reviewer. The approved methods are Codex plus whatever the install names
    as its secondary reviewer — NOT OpenRouter, and never a Genesis internal model. Which
    reviewer that is, if any, is install-local: it belongs in local config, not in a file
    every clone receives.
    This is the only kind that counts, so it REQUIRES a review-outcome flag:
    ``--defects`` (a new BLOCKER/SHOULD-FIX/P1/P2 → +1) or ``--clean`` (none → reset the
    streak, circuit-breaker reset-on-success).
The ``--source`` value describes the review that produced the findings, NOT who typed
the evidence file: a mark recording "verified + fixed Codex's findings" is external; a
mark of your own architect/security audit is internal. (supersedes feea3f71 / #1446 —
the required-outcome trap it closed only ever bit internal re-audits, which now can't
inflate the streak at all; the requirement is kept where it is still load-bearing, on
external marks.)

    The last resort for the post-commit invalidator, for the one case where the
    marker to clear cannot be IDENTIFIED: a command whose parse was stopped by a
    shell_parse bound. The candidate-set over-clear cannot cover it, because a
    repository named only by an explicit selector (``git -C <dir> commit``) is
    discoverable solely from the parse — and a bounded parse returns nothing, by
    design, since a partial one is a wrong answer rather than a weak one. Deriving
    the selector from the raw string instead would be a second, hand-rolled shell
    parser, which is the trap this module's guards were built to avoid.

    So the choice is between clearing markers that were not involved and leaving a
    marker whose commit already happened. This module's cost model settles it: an
    extra clear costs some session a redundant re-review, while a survivor
    authorizes an UNREVIEWED commit for the marker's TTL. MEASURED, this fires on
    0 of 45,956 real commands, so the redundant-review cost is theoretical and the

    WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN TWO CALLS. Which enforcement tier is live is a
    function of BOTH counters. A reader that calls ``get_review_round`` and
    ``get_review_lifetime`` separately performs two independent file reads with two
    independent branch resolutions, so a concurrent ``mark`` landing between them
    yields a PAIR THAT NEVER EXISTED -- e.g. the pre-update ``lifetime=6`` with the
    post-update ``round=3``. A caller deciding a tier from that pair can pick a tier
    the gate will not be in, which is worse than picking none: the whole point of
    naming a tier is to show the user the options that tier actually offers.

    Reading once cannot make the pair inconsistent, and it halves the cost besides
    (one ``git branch --show-current``, not two) -- which matters for the hook-path
    callers that run on every question a session asks.

    THE COMMIT GATE DOES NOT USE THIS YET, and saying otherwise would be exactly the
    kind of claim this accessor exists to make checkable. ``review_enforcement_commit``
    still reads ``get_review_round`` at :934 and ``get_review_lifetime`` at :970, so it
    remains open to the same torn pair -- there it would print the wrong TIER'S BLOCK
    MESSAGE rather than the wrong menu. That is a pre-existing defect in the gate, not
    one this accessor introduces; converting the gate is tracked separately, alongside
    the round file's atomic-write work, since both concern concurrent access to the
    same file.

    Same branch-scoping contract as the two accessors it replaces: a counter written
    for a different branch reads as ``(0, 0)``, because a new change starts fresh.

    Deliberately a rewrite rather than the unlink this used to do. The only
    caller is the escalation-cap ack, whose purpose is to clear the streak so the
    next stop is a fresh cap away — but deleting the file would take the lifetime
    counter with it, and a terminal that its own ack erases is not a terminal.
    So: streak to 0, lifetime and branch carried forward.

    ``last_hash`` is dropped on purpose. It exists to make a re-mark of the SAME
    staged diff idempotent within a streak; once the streak is reset, the next
    defect-bearing mark must be free to count as round 1 whether or not the diff
    moved in between.

    ``last_source`` MUST be written even though this function does not record a
    review. ``_load_round`` discards any counter carrying ``round`` without
    ``last_source`` as a pre-source-axis legacy file — so omitting it here makes
    the very next read throw the whole counter away, silently taking the lifetime
    count with it and leaving the terminal unreachable. Only external rounds are
