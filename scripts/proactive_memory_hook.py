"""UserPromptSubmit hook: proactive memory surfacing (thin client).

Session-local awareness (heartbeat, intent trail, working set, ambient fold)
runs in-process; MEMORY RECALL is delegated to the genesis-server engine via
``POST /api/genesis/hook/recall`` so recall logic (reranker, fusion, entity
lane, graph expansion, injection defense, procedure surfacing) lives in exactly
one place. On any server failure the hook falls back to a degraded FTS5-only
keyword search (no write-backs) so a prompt is never blocked.

Modes (``GENESIS_PROACTIVE_HOOK_MODE``, default ``server``):
  server — call the endpoint; degrade to FTS5 on failure
  local  — skip the endpoint, always use the FTS5 degraded path
  off    — session-local awareness only, no memory recall
Endpoint base URL: ``GENESIS_PROACTIVE_HOOK_URL`` (default http://127.0.0.1:5000).

Budget: <4.75s client (``_SERVER_TIMEOUT_S``) — the server's ~4.5s recall
timeout fires first, so the client gets a clean 503 → FTS5 fallback.

Reads hook input from stdin as JSON:
  {"session_id": "...", "prompt": "...", ...}

# ~2 KB preview with no error and no exit-code change. Losing the peer list or
# the prompt-injection safety directive that way is silent: this file's own
# _heartbeat_read_and_inject notes that a broken read "reads exactly like no
# concurrent sessions".
#
# NO MIRROR, deliberately — the one place this writer's contract is relaxed.
# BoundedStdout asks callers to name a durable mirror because a cut destroys the
# tail. Nothing here is an only copy: every block is a RENDERING of state that
# outlives the cut (session_heartbeats rows, intent_trail.json, the memory store,
# code_symbols). So a cut drops a view, not data, which makes it a selection
# rather than an amputation — and inventing a per-prompt mirror file would add a
# new unbounded store, on the hottest path there is, to protect nothing.
#: Headroom held back from `emit` so a cut can always be ANNOUNCED.
#:
#: Reserving is not by itself enough, and the reason is worth stating because it
#: is the opposite of the obvious reading: BoundedStdout._cut_here computes its
#: own room as `budget - reserve - emitted`, so the reserve is invisible to it
#: too. When a block lands with nothing left, it closes the stream and emits NO
#: marker — the silent stop the whole class of work exists to prevent. Only
#: `emit_final` spends this reserve (it bills against the raw budget and still
#: writes after a cut), so the announcement has to be a closing line, which is
#: what _announce_cut is.
#:
#: 224 = the MEASURED widest rendering of that line (202 units: the longest
#: block label this hook uses, `concurrent-directive`, plus a 7-digit dropped
#: count) with headroom. The first value here was 160, picked by eyeballing the
#: template, and the test below caught it — which is the whole reason the number
#: is asserted against a rendering instead of argued for in a comment. 2.3% of
#: the budget, spent so the full notice fits rather than degrading to the terse
#: fallback every time.

    Two bounds, because one cannot do both jobs. _MAX_KEYWORD_CHARS bounds a
    LABEL (at most 4 keywords, so at most 131 characters); this bounds the LINE.
    A keyword cap tight enough to size the line on its own would have to be
    about 8 characters, which would shred ordinary words.

    Dropping whole pivots rather than cutting mid-line is the point: a truncated
    arrow chain ends in half a topic that reads like a whole one. The elision
    already has a vocabulary here — the ``… →`` prefix that the count bound uses
    — so an over-budget line reuses it rather than inventing a second marker.
    Selecting from the RIGHT keeps the recent end, which is what the line is for.

    _MAX_TRAIL_LINE_CHARS is a COMPATIBILITY bound, so the corpus does choose it:
    of 142 renderable trail lines across 175 live sessions (2026-09-10) the
    longest was 1,448 units and none exceeded 1,500, so 1,600 costs no real line
    anything. It caps a worst case of 6,713 (fifty 131-unit labels) that the
    keyword window alone would still allow through — 69% of the hook's whole
    budget for one metadata line.

    Measured in UTF-16 CODE UNITS, the unit the harness bills. ``len`` was wrong
    here for the same reason it was wrong in _render_code_hint: twenty labels of
    131 ASTRAL characters score 1,491 by ``len`` and 2,932 by the harness, so a
    line 1.83x over the stated ceiling reported as fitting. Astral text is
    reachable from an ordinary prompt — ``str.isalnum`` is True for astral CJK
    and astral digits, so _extract_keywords keeps them.

    LABELS ARE CLIPPED DEFENSIVELY, and that is not belt-and-braces. Labels are
    PERSISTED (~/.genesis/sessions/<id>/intent_trail.json, reaped at 60 days), so
    a trail written BEFORE the keyword window existed holds exactly the unbounded
    labels this change exists to stop — the 131-unit premise above describes new
    labels only. Without the clip a single legacy label wider than the whole line
    budget shrinks `display` to empty and the line VANISHES, which is a worse
    outcome than the one being fixed. _detect_pivot already applies this reasoning
    to stored keywords; this function reads the same file and must not assume the
    file was written by today's code.

    ``window=False`` applies the FLOOR only, skipping the upper bound. It exists
    for one caller: deciding whether a prompt is worth recalling on at all. That
    question must NOT be answered from the bounded list — see the note on
    eligibility below.

    The length window is bounded at BOTH ends. ``>= 3`` drops greetings; the
    upper bound exists because this function caps the keyword COUNT and used to
    leave each keyword's LENGTH unbounded, while ``prompt`` is arbitrary user
    text. Every non-alphanumeric character becomes whitespace above, so an
    IDENTIFIER cannot get long here (MEASURED against this function:
    ``test_a_hardlink_publish_must_clean_up_on_the_SUCCESS_path`` yields 6
    keywords whose longest is 8; a dotted import path yields 11) — but an
    unbroken alphanumeric RUN is one token of whatever length was pasted. A
    2,000-character run reaches the trail line at 16,025 characters on TWO
    pivots, 1.6x the harness cap, and 40x it at fifty.

    DROPPED, not truncated. A keyword is a KEY, not just display text:
    _detect_pivot compares keyword SETS and ``last_keywords`` is stored across
    turns, so truncating would merge two distinct ids that share a prefix into
    one token and make a topic change read as continuity. Dropping also matches
    what these tokens are worth — MEASURED over 175 live intent trails on this
    install (10,613 tokens, 2026-09-10), EVERY token at or above 17 characters
    was an opaque single-use identifier (hex digest, ULID, session id), each
    appearing exactly once, so none could ever match a later prompt; everything
    at or below 16 was an ordinary word (``overcomplicating``,
    ``decommissioning``, ``infrastructure``).

    The threat sets the bound and the corpus only prices it: 32 is double the
    longest real word observed, and it discards 0 of those 10,613 tokens. A
    corpus is EPHEMERAL here — trail files are per-session and get reaped — so
    that is an observation with a date, not a re-runnable query.

    CODEPOINTS, DELIBERATELY — unlike _render_trail_line and _render_code_hint,
    which measure the UTF-16 units the harness bills. This window asks "is this
    token a word or a pasted blob", which is a question about the token, not
    about output size: billing a 20-character astral CJK word as 40 units would
    drop a legitimate word for being non-Latin. The SIZE job belongs to the line
    bound, which is where an astral-heavy label is caught. _detect_pivot's filter
    must use the same unit or the two disagree about what is in the window.

    One caveat on the corpus, scoped honestly: every long token in it was a
    single-use identifier that recurred nowhere, but that was measured on PROMPT
    tokens, not on what they could MATCH. Against memory_fts (90,289 rows) 26
    contain a >32-char alphanumeric run and 9 contain a full 40-hex sha, so a
    dropped token can cost a match — rarely (0.03%), not never. The window is
    still right; the claim supporting it was one population too narrow.

    THE WINDOW MUST NOT DECIDE ELIGIBILITY. A prompt whose only significant
    token is over-window — a bare commit sha, a ULID, a pasted token, an
    unsegmented CJK phrase — extracts NOTHING here, and _run's
    ``len(keywords) < _MIN_PROMPT_WORDS`` gate would then return early and skip
    recall ENTIRELY: not just the local FTS and code lanes, but the SERVER call,
    which receives the raw prompt and runs its own semantic retrieval. That
    would throw away recall this window has no business touching — the window
    governs what gets RENDERED and STORED, not whether the prompt is worth
    answering. Callers ask ``window=False`` for the eligibility question.

    Found by Codex, and missed by my own before/after probe: that probe ran both
    trees in ``local`` mode, where keyword-only FTS finds nothing for a unique
    token either way, so both sides showed no recall and the regression was
    invisible. The one mode that could have shown it is the one I did not run.

    ``signature`` comes from the ``code_symbols`` index with no length cap, and
    this is the largest real model-facing surface in the hook — MEASURED against
    the live index (5,508 public symbols, 2026-09-10): the longest rendered line
    is 1,014 characters and the worst six the SQL can return sum to 4,664, which
    is 47% of the hook's whole budget from code hints alone. Not a pasted-blob
    worst case; today's data.

    The clip lands on the signature because ``loc`` is the ACTIONABLE half — it
    is where to go look — and a bounded pointer to a real file beats a whole
    signature with a mangled path. Marked with an ellipsis so a clipped argument
    list does not read as a complete one. ``clip_to_cost``, not a slice: the
    harness bills UTF-16 code units, and a signature can carry astral text.

    400 is a COMPATIBILITY bound priced against that index: it clips 42 of 5,508
    symbols (0.76%), leaves p99 (365) untouched, and holds the six-hint block
    under 2,400 units.

    MEASURED IN UTF-16 CODE UNITS THROUGHOUT, including the guard — which is the
    half that was wrong first. This function BILLED in UTF-16 (``clip_to_cost``)
    while DECIDING in codepoints (``len``), so an astral signature short enough
    in codepoints to clear the guard was never clipped at all: 200 emoji rendered
    626 units against a stated 400, and the bound was skipped rather than
    loosened. The extremes hide it — at 500+ emoji the guard fires and
    ``clip_to_cost`` bounds correctly — so a probe that only tries a huge value
    reports clean. ``hook_output`` fixed this exact unit-mixing inside itself;
    the lesson is that adopters reintroduce it AT THE GUARD, not at the clip.
