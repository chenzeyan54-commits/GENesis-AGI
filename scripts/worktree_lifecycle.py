"""Worktree lifecycle manager — archives stale worktrees, deletes nothing.

A worktree is only ever touched when it is unused, unlocked, has no paused Git
operation, and contains no nested worktree. Past those protections it is
ARCHIVED into the trash as a gzip tarball, together with a tombstone row. It is
never deleted, and nothing in the trash expires.

That is a deliberate reversal of an earlier design that deleted merged
worktrees outright. The reason is that a worktree can hold the only surviving
trace of the session that produced it: MEASURED 2026-09-10, the session that
authored PR #1702 has no ``cc_sessions`` row and no transcript in any of 532 CC
project directories, so its commits are the entire record of its existence.
Whether a piece of context will matter later is not a judgement a daily timer
is in a position to make, and the storage does not justify guessing — the 192
worktrees present that day were ~11 GB raw, ~2.9 GB archived, against 265 GB
free.

Two lanes remain, but they now differ only in WHEN and in the label they carry,
never in whether the work survives:

  MERGED (7+ days idle)     content is also in main, so it drains sooner
  UNMERGED (14+ days idle)  may be the only copy, so it is held longer

Between day 7 and day 14 an unmerged worktree reports as ``at_risk``: a
bounded, draining window that surfaces work about to be archived, rather than a
list that grows forever.

A detached-HEAD worktree (no branch) is judged by whether its HEAD commit is
already in main; without this it would default to branch "unknown" and never be
considered at all.

Every fate is decided in one place (``_classify`` / ``classify_all``) and merely
carried out by ``main``. ``--report-json`` renders that same classification, so
a dashboard cannot describe a worktree one way while the reaper treats it
another.

Usage:
    worktree_lifecycle.py                    # Run: archive stale worktrees
    worktree_lifecycle.py --dry-run          # Show what would happen
    worktree_lifecycle.py --report-json      # Classify everything, change nothing
    worktree_lifecycle.py --no-network       # Skip the one gh call (faster, safe)
    worktree_lifecycle.py --list-trash       # Show archives with age, lane, size
    worktree_lifecycle.py --recover <name>   # Restore an archived worktree

Run daily by the genesis-disk-hygiene.timer systemd unit (via
scripts/disk_hygiene.sh, alongside disk_reclaim.py). Also runnable by hand.

Stdlib-only (no genesis package imports) — disk_hygiene.sh falls back to the
system python3 when the venv is absent, so an import from the genesis package
would break the reaper on exactly the box that needs it. Uses gh CLI for PR
status.

    One of ``"ancestor"``, ``"pr"``, ``"patch-id"``, or ``""`` (not merged).

    The method matters because only ``"ancestor"`` is safe to act on
    IRREVERSIBLY. It means the ref is genuinely reachable from main's history,
    so the commits survive any GC. The other two are inferences: ``"pr"`` trusts
    GitHub's merged flag, and ``"patch-id"`` trusts ``git cherry``, whose own
    blind spot is documented below (it omits merge commits entirely, so a unique
    merge commit reads as "no unique work"). MEASURED on this repo 2026-09-10:
    it squash-merges, so 20 of 26 merged verdicts came from ``patch-id``.
    Irreversibility must not rest on the method with a known blind spot — see
    the tombstone index, which records what a reaped worktree uniquely held.

    ``allow_network=False`` skips method 2 (the only method that hits the
    network), for callers on a latency budget. It can only ever turn a ``"pr"``
    verdict into ``""`` or ``"patch-id"``; it never invents a merged verdict.

    ``ref`` is a branch name (``is_branch=True``) or, for a detached-HEAD
    worktree, its HEAD commit SHA (``is_branch=False``).

    For a BRANCH, three methods in order:
    1. git merge-base --is-ancestor (fast; branch tip is an ancestor of main)
    2. gh pr list --head <branch> --state merged (handles squash merges)
    3. Zero unique commits vs main (git cherry; patch-id equivalence)

    For a DETACHED HEAD, ONLY Method 1 (true ancestor of main) is trusted; the
    patch-id method (3) and the PR method (2) are skipped. This is deliberate: a
    bare commit referenced only by the worktree HEAD has no branch protecting it,
    so reaping a merely patch-equivalent (non-ancestor) commit would let a GC
    collect it inside the recovery window; and ``git cherry`` omits merge commits
    entirely (no patch id), so a unique merge commit would be mis-read as "no
    unique work" and wrongly reaped. A true ancestor is both genuinely in main's
    history AND reachable (GC-safe). The cost is fail-safe: a detached HEAD whose
    work reached main only by squash/rebase (patch-equal but not an ancestor) is
    kept, never reaped.

    which routes it to the slower, recoverable lane).
