# Agent Instructions

Cross-tool agent entry point (Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, …). The canonical
project instructions live in **CLAUDE.md** — read it first; everything below
is supplementary.

## Code Review Mandate (adversarial)

When reviewing a diff or PR (including automated PR review), review ADVERSARIALLY,
not to confirm:

- **Assume there are latent bugs and enumerate the CLASS.** For each concern, find
  EVERY instance, not one example — edge/boundary/sentinel/hierarchy/error cases,
  empty/None/zero/single-element inputs, rename/binary/unicode paths. A single
  spot-check is not a review. Do not confidence-filter to "no findings"; a
  precision-filtered "looks good" on a substantial change is false confidence.
- **READ the authoritative semantics before judging domain code** (cgroup/systemd,
  SQLite/WAL, async/cancellation, timezones, git plumbing, cryptography). Reason from
  the spec/source, not assumption — assumption is what produces serial defects.
- **Quote `file:line` for every finding**, state why it matters in THIS codebase, and
  rank by real severity: **P1** (bug/security/data-loss) · **P2** (wrong under edge
  conditions, missing handling) · **P3** (quality/nit). Generic advice ("validate
  input") without a specific code path is not P1.
- **Check the fix does not REMOVE constraints** (validation, guards, type enforcement)
  and does not break existing behavior; a finding whose "fix" regresses something is
  itself a finding. Verify claims against the code — a stated mechanism can be wrong
  even when the concern is real.
- **Historical/removed behavior quoted in comments is not a current bug.** A fix's
  comments and commit messages routinely *quote the old vulnerable pattern* to justify
  the change ("this closes the fail-open where `strict=False` let it through"; "NEL-safe:
  splits on `\n`, NOT `splitlines()`"). Before flagging a concern, confirm the pattern
  exists in the **current code** — grep the code, not the prose. A symbol or clause that
  appears ONLY inside a comment describing what was removed is a FALSE POSITIVE, not a
  P1/P2; flagging it re-opens a closed loop round after round.
- **Calibrate severity to the code's DECLARED threat model — do not harden low-stakes
  code ad infinitum.** Adversarial rigor above stays FULL for high-consequence surfaces
  (auth, credentials, financial, data-loss, external input, approval gates). But a
  guard/module often states its own scope — e.g. "accident-prevention on a single-author
  repo, not adversarial; a deliberate evader already has `python -c 'subprocess…'`,
  invisible to any string guard." Weigh findings against THAT model: a bypass that
  requires deliberate multi-step evasion of an *accident-prevention* layer is a **NOTE /
  P3**, not a P1. **Do not re-flag documented accepted-residue** — a form the code
  explicitly marks out-of-scope ("accepted residue", "outside the threat model") — as a
  new blocking finding round after round. When, after ~3 review→fix rounds on one change,
  the only new findings are adjacent evasion variants on such a surface, say so in the
  verdict ("remaining items are out-of-threat-model residue, not blocking") instead of
  continuing to enumerate: over-hardening code whose functionality doesn't warrant it is
  itself a review failure.
- **"The approach itself is wrong" is a legitimate review verdict — say it when the
  evidence supports it.** Rounds accumulate for two different reasons and the round
  count cannot tell them apart: a sound solution carrying defects converges, while a
  WRONG-SHAPED solution does not — each fix creates the surface for the next finding,
  so the loop reads like whack-a-mole while it is really a design error accruing
  interest. You are the only reviewer positioned to notice, because the author has
  three rounds of sunk cost and the read-model that produced the design.
  Three signals, none of which requires you to judge intent — all are visible in the
  diff and the review history:
  * findings CONCENTRATE in one file or one function rather than scattering;
  * a finding lands on a line THIS pull request itself added in an earlier round
    (the fix is generating its own bug supply);
  * the diff GROWS across rounds instead of shrinking.
  When two or more hold, say so plainly and name the alternative shape — delete the
  mechanism, move it one layer up, make the problem impossible rather than detected.
  A denylist defeated by a caller does not become correct by enumerating callers.
  Scope it honestly, because the opposite error is just as expensive: findings that
  SCATTER across a diff, each with a local fix, are ordinary defects in a sound
  design, and telling that author their architecture is wrong sends them hunting a
  problem that is not there. Absent the signals, review the code.
- **End with a verdict:** `Ready to merge: Yes | No | With fixes` + a one-line reason.

### Documentation is out of scope for review

Do not review CHANGELOG entries, release notes, README, or ordinary `docs/`
prose, and do not raise findings on them. They ship no behaviour: an imprecise
sentence in a changelog cannot break an install, while a review round spent on
one costs the same as a round spent on the code that can. Skip them and put the
whole budget on executable code.

This does NOT relax factual accuracy where prose makes a CHECKABLE claim about
behaviour — "restores the previous behaviour exactly", "defaults to off", a
config key or a path. If such a statement contradicts the diff it describes, that
is a code-adjacent defect and is still worth one line. The distinction is between
*wrong* and merely *improvable*: report the first, ignore the second.

<!-- BEGIN prose-review-scope (temporary; remove this block to restore full prose review) -->
### Prompts, skills and other prose: basic factual accuracy only

Markdown, agent and skill definitions, and other prose surfaces get a
FACTUAL-ACCURACY pass, not the adversarial enumeration above. Check that what the
text asserts matches the code it describes — a named file, function, flag,
default or command that does not exist, or a claim the diff contradicts. Stop
there.

Do not enumerate wording, structure, tone, completeness, redundancy, or
hypothetical misreadings by a future reader, and do not open a finding whose
remedy is a rewrite for clarity. Prose in this repository is deliberately long
and argumentative because it has to survive being read out of context by a fresh
session; density there is a feature, and reviewing it as if it were code produces
volume without defects.

Executable code is unaffected by this section — review it in full.

## GitNexus — Code Intelligence (advisory)

This repo is indexed by GitNexus. The MCP tools (`impact`, `query`,
`context`, `explain`, `trace`, `detect_changes`) give call-graph, blast-radius,
and execution-flow answers that grep can't. Use them when they fit the
question — **none is a mandatory pre-edit gate** (see CLAUDE.md → Code
Intelligence for the tool-selection matrix; Serena is the live-symbol
default, GitNexus is snapshot-based so run `node .gitnexus/run.cjs analyze`
first when freshness matters).

Useful entry points:

| Tool/Resource | Use for |
|---|---|
| `impact({target, direction: "upstream"})` | multi-hop blast radius before large refactors |
| `query({search_query})` | find execution flows by concept |
| `context({name})` | callers/callees/flows for one symbol |
| `detect_changes({scope: "compare", base_ref: "main"})` | regression-scope check on a branch |
| `gitnexus://repo/GENesis-AGI/processes` | all indexed execution flows |

GitNexus doc/skill injection is disabled at the source via the committed
`.gitnexusrc` (`skipAgentsMd` + `skipSkills`) — this file is hand-curated;
`surplus/jobs/gitnexus.py` strips any marker block an rc-unaware GitNexus
version re-injects.

## Genesis Capability Surface

Body-scope inventory for cross-tool agents — Genesis's skills and action tools. Memory and cognition (the brain) are intentionally excluded.

### Skills

- **aws-fde-delivery** — Forward Deployed Engineer delivery contract for AWS engagements, build-first artifacts, grounded cost estimates, Well-Architected review, evolution roadmap
- **browser-automation** — Web automation with 4-layer escalation (Fetch, Genesis Browser, On-Demand MCP, Computer Use), anti-detection, and persistent profiles
- **cc-update** — Update Claude Code (the CC CLI / "clog code") to a new version, or bump the pinned CC version. Use when the user asks to update Claude Code, bump the CC pin, evaluate a new CC release, or says "clog code update". Routes to the canonical, standardized process in docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md — do NOT re-derive the update mechanism by grepping every time. Do NOT use for general "what changed in CC" trivia with no intent to update.
- **closing-session** — This skill should be used when a session's job is to DRIVE OPEN PRs TO MERGE rather than to write new code — "close out the open PRs", "review and fix the open PRs", "what's blocking our PRs", "which PRs are mergeable". It owns the In Review column: it reads each PR's gate status, verifies and fixes review findings on PRs OTHER sessions built, replies in-thread, and stops at the merge gate for the user's per-PR approval. Do NOT load it for building a feature and opening its PR — that is a build session (`genesis-development`).
- **code-intelligence** — Code understanding tool selection. Use when exploring architecture, finding definitions, tracing call chains, assessing blast radius of changes, or debugging code paths in the Genesis codebase.
- **content-publish** — End-to-end content creation and publishing. Takes a topic (or generates one), drafts in the user's voice, gets approval via Telegram, and publishes to Medium via browser automation. Invoke with "publish a post about X", "write and publish to Medium", "content-publish", or when an ego-dispatched session needs to create and distribute content.
- **debugging** — Systematic debugging of issues — use when a test fails, runtime error occurs, unexpected behavior is reported, or an awareness tick produces anomalous results
- **deliverable-builder** — Produce a professional, send-ready deliverable on the user's behalf — in the correct file format (never raw markdown), in the user's voice, structured to lead with the strongest material, and free of document-level AI tells. Runs a gated pipeline with a fresh-context verification policeman and a Stop-hook that won't let the session finish without a verified PASS. Use when producing a job take-home, client report, executive one-pager, slide deck, proposal, or anything going out under the user's name.
- **evaluate** — Evaluate technologies and competitive developments against Genesis architecture
- **forecasting** — Superforecasting with calibrated reasoning, Brier score tracking, and prediction ledger management
- **genesis-development** — This skill should be used when developing, debugging, refactoring, or building Genesis itself — tasks like "fix this in Genesis", "add a new MCP tool", "wire up the runtime", "Genesis won't start", "create a worktree", "debug the bridge", or "add a capability". Applies to any task modifying files under src/, .claude/, or tests/. Do NOT load for Genesis-as-tool work ("summarize this", "write a LinkedIn post", "research X") or general questions unrelated to Genesis internals.
- **genesis-voice** — Apply when Genesis writes as itself — outreach, public content, community posts, emails, DMs. Not for writing in the user's voice (that's voice-master). Activate when Genesis is the author, not the ghostwriter.
- **gitnexus-cli** — Use when the user needs to run GitNexus CLI commands like analyze/index a repo, check status, clean the index, generate a wiki, or list indexed repos. Examples: "Index this repo", "Reanalyze the codebase", "Generate a wiki"
- **gitnexus-debugging** — Use when the user is debugging a bug, tracing an error, or asking why something fails. Examples: "Why is X failing?", "Where does this error come from?", "Trace this bug"
- **gitnexus-exploring** — Use when the user asks how code works, wants to understand architecture, trace execution flows, or explore unfamiliar parts of the codebase. Examples: "How does X work?", "What calls this function?", "Show me the auth flow"
- **gitnexus-guide** — Use when the user asks about GitNexus itself — available tools, how to query the knowledge graph, MCP resources, graph schema, or workflow reference. Examples: "What GitNexus tools are available?", "How do I use GitNexus?"
- **gitnexus-impact-analysis** — Use when the user wants to know what will break if they change something, or needs safety analysis before editing code. Examples: "Is it safe to change X?", "What depends on this?", "What will break?"
- **gitnexus-refactoring** — Use when the user wants to rename, extract, split, move, or restructure code safely. Examples: "Rename this function", "Extract this into a module", "Refactor this class", "Move this to a separate file"
- **integrate-module** — Turn any external program into a Genesis module via structured discovery, connection mapping, config generation, and verification.
- **lead-generation** — Prospect discovery, enrichment, scoring, and reporting against an Ideal Customer Profile
- **linkedin-comment-strategy** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a comment for this LinkedIn post", "help me respond to this post", "what should I comment on this", "craft a LinkedIn comment", or when Genesis identifies high-value posts in the user's network worth engaging with. Also triggered by "how should I engage on LinkedIn" or "help me be more visible on LinkedIn".
- **linkedin-content-calendar** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "plan my LinkedIn content", "create a content calendar", "what should I post about this week", "plan my posting schedule", or when Genesis proactively suggests a weekly content plan during surplus compute. Also triggered by "I need post ideas" or "I don't know what to write about".
- **linkedin-dm-outreach** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a LinkedIn message", "draft a connection request", "help me reach out to someone on LinkedIn", "write an InMail", "message this person", or when the prospect-researcher skill identifies a high-value contact worth reaching out to. Also triggered by "how should I approach [person/company]" in a LinkedIn context.
- **linkedin-hook-writer** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a hook for my post", "give me opening lines", "help me start this LinkedIn post", "I need a better opener", or when the linkedin-post-writer skill needs strong opening options. Also triggered by "my posts aren't getting clicks" or "how do I get people to read my posts".
- **linkedin-post-writer** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a LinkedIn post", "draft a post about", "help me post on LinkedIn", "create LinkedIn content", or when Genesis proactively generates post ideas during surplus compute. Also triggered by content calendar execution or when the user shares a topic they want to write about.
- **linkedin-profile-optimizer** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "optimize my LinkedIn profile", "update my LinkedIn headline", "rewrite my LinkedIn summary", "improve my LinkedIn about section", or when Genesis identifies that the user's profile doesn't align with their current goals or target audience.
- **obstacle-resolution** — Resolve obstacles using fallback chains — use when an approach fails, a dependency is unavailable, an API returns errors, or a task is blocked and needs an alternative path forward
- **onboarding** — First-run onboarding — guides new users through Genesis setup on their first CC session. Configures user profile, essential API keys, Telegram, GitHub backup, and service verification. Triggered automatically while the install is not yet FUNCTIONAL (the setup floor — Claude Code login + an LLM key + an embedding key — is unmet), not merely while ~/.genesis/setup-complete is absent. Re-runnable by asking Genesis to "run setup" or "reconfigure [section]".
- **osint** — OSINT investigation — discover, track, and report on people, companies, and technologies
- **prospect-researcher** — This skill should be used when the user asks to "research this company", "look into this person", "find the best angle for reaching out to", "who should I contact at [company]", "what does [company] care about", or when preparing outreach to a specific target. Also triggered by "help me prepare for an interview with [company]" or "I want to apply to [company]". Combines lead-generation intelligence with LinkedIn-specific approach planning.
- **research** — Deep research on a topic — use when investigating unfamiliar domains, answering complex questions requiring multiple sources, or when an evaluation flags something for deeper analysis
- **retrospective** — Post-interaction retrospective analysis — use after completing a significant task, conversation, or phase to extract lessons, identify process improvements, and update procedures
- **shelve** — Shelve the current session — create a bookmark so you can find and resume it later with /unshelve.
- **stealth-browser** — Anti-detection behavioral rules for stealth browser automation
- **subsystem-map** — This skill should be used before answering "does Genesis have X", "does Genesis lack X", auditing Genesis capabilities, comparing Genesis to an external system, or reviewing/summarizing the architecture. It routes to the canonical judgment-layer subsystem map so audits start from the map, not from a cold grep. Also fires after changing a subsystem's capabilities, to keep the map current.
- **taste** — Use before generating, editing, or reviewing any user interface — a dashboard panel, a landing page, an email, a slide, an app screen. Sets three deliberate design dials (variance, motion, density) BEFORE generation so the output has a point of view instead of defaulting to the timid, uniform look that reads as "AI made this". Applies to Genesis's OWN dashboard UI, not only things built for others.
- **triage-calibration** — Daily triage accuracy calibration — use during scheduled calibration runs to verify triage classification accuracy against few-shot examples and adjust confidence thresholds
- **unshelve** — Search for shelved sessions — find past bookmarked sessions by keyword or browse recent ones.
- **user_evaluate** — Evaluate content for personal relevance to the user using the user model
- **video-processing** — Download, transcribe, analyze, and clip video content — vertical shorts, captions, thumbnails
- **voice-master** — Foundational voice authority and AI humanizer — writes content in the user's authentic voice with built-in AI detection, and supports stealth / anti- attribution writing (forum personas, anonymous posts, "write as not-me"). Use when asked to write/draft/generate content, invoke /voice, /write-as-me, or /humanize, run voice calibration, check "does this sound like me?", "make this sound human" / "de-AI this", "write a forum post as [persona]", or run AI detection ("does this sound like AI?", "check for AI patterns", "anti-slop check"). Do NOT use this skill for code, technical docs, or any output the user has not asked to be written in their voice — code styling defers to the separate code-voice skill.
- **web-research** — Evidence-driven web and open-source research for questions that require multiple sources, factual verification, comparisons, or an adopt/adapt/build decision. Use for substantial research in foreground sessions, the genesis-researcher subagent, and research-profile background sessions. Skip for a single stable fact or a known URL that only needs fetching.
- **youtube-fetch** — Fetches YouTube video metadata and transcripts using yt-dlp. Activate when the user shares a YouTube URL (youtube.com, youtu.be), asks to 'fetch this video', 'get the transcript', 'what does this video say', 'summarize this YouTube video', or references video content that needs to be retrieved. Also activate when processing multiple YouTube URLs in batch. Do NOT use for non-YouTube video platforms, local video files, or audio-only podcast URLs.
