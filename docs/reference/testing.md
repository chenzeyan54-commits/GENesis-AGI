# Testing Guide

## Running Tests

All tests run from the genesis project root using pytest:

```bash
source ~/genesis/.venv/bin/activate
cd genesis

# Full suite
pytest -v

# Specific subsystem
pytest -v tests/test_memory/
pytest -v tests/test_resilience/

# Linting (run before committing)
ruff check .

# Both (standard pre-commit check)
ruff check . && pytest -v
```

## Test Suite Overview

Genesis v3 has **~21,000 test functions** across **~1,345 files** (counted
2026-09-06 by `grep -rEh "^\s*(async )?def test_" tests/ --include=*.py | wc -l`;
parametrized cases make the collected item count higher still). The suite runs
without external service dependencies -- Qdrant, Ollama, and LLM APIs are
mocked in unit tests.

**Runtime.** CI runs the suite FULLY SERIALLY (no pytest-xdist; it is not a
dependency). MEASURED 2026-09-06 over the last 23 successful `main` runs, for
the **`test` job specifically** (`gh api .../actions/runs/<id>/jobs`, name ==
`test`): min 19m38s, median 29m22s, max 31m15s. Do not quote workflow-RUN
duration here — it is ~20 minutes longer because it spans 12 sibling jobs plus
queue time, and it is not what any of the ceilings below bound.

Two ceilings bound the suite, and they are different things:

- `timeout = 3600` in `pyproject.toml` is pytest-timeout's **per-test** limit —
  one hung test is killed and the suite continues. It is NOT a suite budget,
  and it applies **in CI only**: `pytest-timeout` ships in the `[test]` extra,
  so a local `pip install -e .` venv does not have it and pytest emits
  `PytestConfigWarning: Unknown config option: timeout` on every local run.
  Install with `pip install -e ".[test]"` if you want it locally.
- `timeout-minutes: 180` on CI's `test` job bounds the whole job, for a hang
  the per-test timeout cannot catch. It must stay above (max job + one
  per-test kill) — 31m15s + 60m ≈ 91m — or it would pre-empt the per-test
  limit and make it dead code.

The per-test cost of individual tests had never been measured; CI now prints
`--durations=25` so the slowest are visible in every run's log. Read them
before changing either ceiling.

## Test Directory Structure

Tests are organized by subsystem, mirroring `src/genesis/`:

## Key Testing Patterns

### Subsystem Isolation

Each test directory is self-contained. Tests mock external dependencies
(Qdrant client, LLM API calls, filesystem) so they run without live services.
The shared `conftest.py` at the test root provides common fixtures for
database setup, mock providers, and temporary directories.

### Mock Patterns

- **LLM calls**: Mocked via provider adapters. Tests assert on prompt
  construction and response handling, not on actual LLM output.
- **Qdrant**: `AsyncQdrantClient` is mocked. Collection operations return
  controlled fixtures.
- **Database**: Tests use temporary SQLite databases created per-test or
  per-module. The `genesis_db` fixture in `conftest.py` handles setup and
  teardown.
- **Asyncio**: Tests use `pytest-asyncio` for async test functions. Background
  tasks use `tracked_task()` which is tested for proper lifecycle management.

### Fixture Organization

Shared fixtures live in `tests/conftest.py`. Subsystem-specific fixtures live
in `tests/test_<subsystem>/conftest.py`. This layering keeps fixtures close
to where they are used while avoiding duplication.

### Safety-Critical Tests

Some tests verify safety invariants that protect production data and system
stability:

- **Qdrant delete guard** (`test_security/`): Verifies that bulk collection
  deletes are blocked unless explicitly overridden.
- **PGID validation** (`test_cc/`): Verifies that process kill operations
  validate PGID > 1 before calling `os.killpg()`.
- **Hook enforcement** (`test_hooks/`): Verifies that PreToolUse hooks
  correctly block dangerous tool invocations.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests in `tests/integration/` require running external services
(Qdrant, Ollama). They are not run as part of the standard `pytest` invocation.
Run them explicitly when you have the services available:

```bash
pytest -v tests/integration/
```

## Adding Tests

When adding a new subsystem or feature:

1. Create `tests/test_<subsystem>/` with an `__init__.py`.
2. Add subsystem-specific fixtures in `tests/test_<subsystem>/conftest.py`.
3. Mock external dependencies; do not require live services for unit tests.
4. Verify the new tests pass in isolation: `pytest -v tests/test_<subsystem>/`.
