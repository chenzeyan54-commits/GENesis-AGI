# Memory Resilience — swap + systemd-oomd, the adaptive way

## The invariant

**A memory spike must degrade into swap pressure and a userspace OOM kill of
the greedy process tree — never into load-100 D-state thrash that wedges the
whole machine.**

Genesis is a process-heavy system: a cognitive server, per-session Claude Code
trees, MCP servers, indexers. On a box with no swap and no userspace OOM
killer, the first component to over-allocate doesn't fail alone — the kernel
enters direct-reclaim thrash, load climbs into the tens or hundreds, SSH stops
answering, and *everything* on the machine dies together. One incident series
(2026-07) produced exactly this failure mode four times from four unrelated
causes; the common factor was the missing relief valve, not any single leak.

The fingerprint, if you're diagnosing it live:

- load average 50–130 with mostly-idle CPUs (processes stuck in `D` state)
- SSH connections drop or hang; `incus exec` hangs from the host
- inside a container: `cat /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.swap.max` shows `0`
- `swapon --show` empty on the host/VM

## What Genesis sets up (and what it only warns about)

`scripts/lib/memory_resilience.sh` runs from `install.sh` and `bootstrap.sh` on
fresh installs and from every `update.sh` (which re-runs bootstrap), so existing
installs retrofit automatically. It is idempotent and **adaptive — every threshold is a
pressure percentage, never an absolute byte value**, so the same config
right-sizes from a small VPS to a large workstation:

- `/etc/systemd/system/user.slice.d/genesis-oomd.conf` —
  `ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=kill` at **60%** memory-pressure (PSI) on the
  user slice: the backstop monitor.
- `/etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/genesis-oomd.conf` — `kill` for the
  per-user manager. In practice this is the operative monitor (many distros
  ship a 50% default limit for it; ours guarantees `kill` where the distro
  ships `auto` or nothing).
- `/etc/systemd/oomd.conf.d/genesis.conf` — swap-use limit 90%, default
  pressure limit 60%, 20s duration.
- `genesis-server.service` carries `ManagedOOMPreference=avoid`, so oomd prefers
  killing the greedy session tree over the cognitive core. `avoid` is honored by
  the per-user monitor (same-UID cgroup ownership) — see
  systemd.resource-control(5).
- Its kernel-side `OOMScoreAdjust` is **`100`, not a negative value**, and that
  is a constraint rather than a preference. A user manager cannot lower
  `oom_score_adj` below the `oom_score_adj_min` of 0 it inherits from init;
  doing so needs `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`, which the manager does not hold, and the
  write fails **silently**. MEASURED 2026-09-08: the unit declared `-500` while
  the live process ran at `100`, and had since the line was written. Raising
  always works, lowering never does — so the kill order is built by pushing
  sacrificial processes UP (CC subprocesses to 500), never by protecting the
  server DOWN. Deleting the declaration would be worse than a wrong value:
  unset units report systemd's default of **200**, which is more killable than
  100.

Graceful degradation: no systemd, no `systemd-oomd`, no kernel PSI, or no
non-interactive sudo each produce a one-line skip note, never a failure.

**Swap itself is verified, not created.** The setup warns — with the exact
remediation for the detected vantage — because the knob is never local:

- **Inside a container** (LXC/Incus): swap capability is granted by the host.
  Fix on the host: `incus config set <container> limits.memory.swap true`,
  and make sure the host itself has swap. `host-setup.sh` does both for
  managed installs (and warns if the host is swapless). On guardian-managed
  hosts the invariant is also **self-healing**: the guardian's swap
  reconciler (`guardian/swap_watch.py`) re-asserts the config knob *and*
  live-activates the cgroup (`memory.swap.max`) each tick — covering installs
  that advance via bare `git pull` and never re-run host-setup. A heal pages
  an INFO alert; opt a host out with `swap_reconcile_enabled: false` in the
  guardian config (an explicitly-false knob is otherwise reconciled back to
  true — swap-on is the install invariant).
- **Bare metal / VM**: create a swapfile or LV sized to taste. Even a few
  GiB turns the OOM cliff into a ramp. **On guardian hosts this is now
  mechanical** — see the zram layer below.

## The zram layer (guardian hosts)

`scripts/lib/host_swap.sh` gives guardian host VMs a **compressed-RAM-first
swap tier**: a zram device at swap priority 100, so memory pressure compresses
into fast RAM before touching disk swap (which stays as the lower-priority
fallback). On a host with *no* swap at all, this closes the wedge-defect gap
mechanically instead of leaving the warning above as the only output.

- **Size**: `min(MemTotal/2, 4 GiB)` — zram-generator's own upstream default
  formula, computed per machine at apply time (a 2 GiB VPS gets 1 GiB, big
  hosts cap at 4 GiB). Override the cap with `HOSTSWAP_CAP_GIB`.
- **Unit**: a self-contained root-level `zram-swap.service` (oneshot,
  `RemainAfterExit`) written to `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system/` (NOT /etc —
  `systemctl mask` needs the /etc path free to plant its /dev/null symlink,
  so the documented opt-out actually works) — fixed `/dev/zram0`,
  zstd compression with automatic fallback to the kernel default, no
  genesis-path dependencies. Idempotent: an unchanged unit produces no
  systemd churn; a RAM change re-renders it.
- **Applied from**: `install_guardian.sh` Step 9c (fresh installs) and the
  gateway `redeploy` verb (existing installs retrofit on their next update).
- **Degrades to a one-line skip** when the machine can't or shouldn't:
  not-systemd, container vantage (zram needs the real host kernel), no
  `zramctl`/`zram.ko`, no non-interactive sudo, `HOSTSWAP_DISABLE=1`, an
  external zram setup already active (never shadows zram-generator or an
  operator's own device), or a masked unit.
- **Opt out permanently**: `sudo systemctl mask zram-swap.service` — apply
  skips masked units. Remove cleanly with
  `sudo bash -c 'source scripts/lib/host_swap.sh && host_swap_remove'`.
- The host-plane `swap_total_kb` fact (table above) picks the device up
  automatically, and `_memres_swap_check` stops warning once it's active.

## The PID/task budget (fork-exhaustion guard)

Memory isn't the only slice-level budget that wedges. systemd's stock
`user-.slice.d/10-defaults.conf` caps every per-user slice at **`TasksMax=33%`**
— a conservative multi-user-server default. On a single-user Genesis appliance
running many concurrent Claude Code sessions (each spawns MCP subprocess trees:
codebase-memory, serena, gitnexus, the codex broker), 33% of the box's PID
budget is exhausted well before memory/CPU/disk, so new processes fail with
**`Cannot fork`** while every other axis reads green.

`pid_budget_apply` (in `scripts/lib/memory_resilience.sh`, run from
`install.sh`/`bootstrap.sh`/`update.sh` alongside the oomd setup) lays down
`/etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d/90-genesis-tasksmax.conf` →
**`TasksMax=60%`**. Like the pressure thresholds it is a **percentage, not an
absolute count**, so it self-calibrates to each box's own budget. **60%, not
unlimited, is deliberate:** reserving ~40% keeps `system.slice`
(sshd/systemd/dbus/init) alive so a runaway in the user slice can never wedge
the whole container — it stays recoverable. `90-` sorts after systemd's `10-`
default so last-assignment-wins makes 60% the effective cap. Same graceful
degradation as the oomd setup (no systemd / no non-interactive sudo → one-line
skip); when it can't apply, the posture check below surfaces the un-raised
ceiling rather than letting the box run silently capped.

**Raising or lowering it.** 60% is the shipped default; adjust in consultation
with your own Genesis if your box's resources or session count differ — drop a
higher-numbered override (e.g. `/etc/systemd/system/user-.slice.d/95-local.conf`
with a different `TasksMax=`), or `sudo systemctl set-property user-<uid>.slice
TasksMax=<value>` for a runtime change. The live PID budget is on the dashboard
Container panel (amber ≥ 80%, red ≥ 90%), and the awareness loop raises an
explanatory alert on approach.

## How the body schema surfaces it

The infrastructure profile (`INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `infra_profile` package)
records the invariant as facts, so drift is observed and the annotation layer
flags unprotected installs:

| Fact | Plane | Healthy | Wedge-defect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cgroup_memory_swap_max` | container | `"max"` (or an int) | `0` |
| `oomd_user_slice_kill` | container | `true` | `false` |
| `pid_ceiling_effective_ok` | container | `true` | `false` |
| `swap_total_kb` | host | > 0 | `0` |
| `container_limits["limits.memory.swap"]` | host_virt | `"true"`/absent | `"false"` |

**The posture alert (active signal).** Facts and annotations alone proved
insufficient — `infra_profile` only emits `infrastructure_drift` on a fact
*change*, so a box that was *always* unprotected produced no signal at all
(observed live: a sibling install ran for weeks with swap disabled and no
systemd-oomd until a memory spike wedged it). The awareness loop's hourly
`_check_infra_protection_posture` (`awareness/loop.py`) closes that: any
wedge-defect value in the table above raises one non-paging `high`
`infrastructure_alert` (dashboard + morning report) naming the missing
protections and their remediation, auto-resolving when the profile shows them
restored. Only *explicit* defect values alert — absent/`None` facts stay
silent (no guardian host plane, cgroup v1, fresh install), so partial installs
never false-alarm. The `pid_ceiling_unprovisioned` rule rides the same check:
`pid_ceiling_effective_ok` reflects the *effective* slice `pids.max` (so a
runtime `set-property` override is judged correctly, not just the drop-in file),
and `false` — the ceiling still on systemd's 33% default — raises the alert with
the remedy above. A profile older than 3 days raises a distinct
"posture UNKNOWN — refresh broken" alert instead of asserting from dead facts.
The same check also covers the **network plane** (KeepConfiguration + the
networkd watchdog), gated so it only fires on networkd-managed boxes — see
`docs/reference/network-resilience.md` → "The posture alert (active signal)".

## Notes

- This userspace layer is complementary to the **kernel-side** OOM tuning
  Genesis already applies on guardian hosts
  (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-genesis-oom-tuning.conf` via `install_guardian.sh` /
  `host-setup.sh`: `vm.min_free_kbytes`, `vm.watermark_scale_factor`,
  `vm.oom_kill_allocating_task`). The sysctls shape *kernel reclaim and the
  kernel OOM killer*; systemd-oomd acts *earlier*, on pressure, in userspace.
  Tune them as two layers of one defense, not competing knobs.
- Inside a container, systemd-oomd's swap-based kills are inert (the
  container can't see swap devices); the **pressure** path is the active
  mechanism. The swap limit line matters on bare/VM installs.
- These kills are a last line of defense, not a workload manager. If oomd
  ever kills `genesis-server` itself, the pressure limit is mis-tuned for
  that machine — raise the percentage or investigate what drove sustained
  PSI, and file the incident.

## What a live fire drill proved (2026-07)

The full stack was drilled on a production install (16 GiB container, 7.3 GiB
host swap) with deliberate memory balloons. Findings worth knowing before you
tune anything:

- **The swap layer is what absorbs almost everything.** An idle 7.6 GiB
  balloon was absorbed silently; a single 12 GiB *churning* balloon ran for
  hours without wedging the machine — the exact stimulus class that
  previously took the box down in minutes.
- **At hard exhaustion, the KERNEL OOM killer fires first, and that's fine.**
  A four-process churn storm (~13 GiB hot working set) exceeded RAM + swap
  and was killed by the kernel within ~2 minutes (`memory.events` `oom_kill`
  is the counter to check — inside a container you cannot see the host's
  dmesg, and `journalctl -u systemd-oomd` staying empty does NOT mean nothing
  fired). `genesis-server` survived that episode — but NOT because of
  `OOMScoreAdjust=-500`, which this note originally credited. That value never
  applied (see above); the server was running at an effective `100` throughout,
  which still outranked the session tree the kernel chose instead. The outcome
  was right; the stated reason was not.
- **systemd-oomd thresholds against the *full* PSI metric** — the fraction of
  time ALL tasks in the cgroup were stalled simultaneously (see
  systemd.oomd(5)) — not the `some` line most dashboards show. A single
  greedy process can push `some` past 60% while `full` stays in single
  digits: oomd correctly stays quiet because everything else is still making
  progress off swap. Its unique window — sustained all-tasks stall *without*
  hard memory.max exhaustion — is narrow by design. Don't lower its
  percentages chasing kills the kernel layer already delivers; that only buys
  collateral kills during legitimate heavy bursts.
- Net: the wedge fingerprint at the top of this doc is covered twice over —
  swap turns the cliff into a ramp, and whichever of kernel-OOM (hard
  exhaustion) or oomd (sustained all-stall) triggers first takes the greedy
  tree while the server survives.
- Quality-over-cost still applies: nothing here throttles or degrades
  Genesis under pressure; it only decides *what dies first* when the machine
  is already out of headroom.
