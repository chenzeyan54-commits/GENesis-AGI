## Current CC Version

**Pinned:** Claude Code **2.1.246** (bumped 2026-08-31 from 2.1.218; a 25-release, fixes-dominated delta — see Version History for the evaluation). Deployment path: the gated sequence in §Updating Claude Code — evaluate (incl. the mandatory full-changelog read) → soak the candidate on the container → **then** merge the pin, after which one `scripts/update.sh` run aligns the container via `cc_ensure_local` and syncs the host via the guardian `update-cc` op. The merge-then-`update.sh` half is the *deployment* mechanism, not the whole procedure: a bump that starts there has skipped the gates. The `cc-update` skill routes to §Updating. Node floor unchanged (`>=22`; 2.1.246 declares `engines.node >=22.0.0`, verified against the npm registry — as does 2.1.251, so the next cycle does not move it either). Prior state: 2.1.218 on both machines from 2026-07-22; the container ran the 2.1.246 candidate from 2026-08-25 under the inherited-`CC_VERSION` soak lever while the host stayed on the pin, which is the documented rollback path and why the two machines were deliberately split during the soak. **Both** container and host install Claude Code **via npm-global** (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>` — the container auto-detects its npm prefix; the host uses `sudo npm install -g`, resolving `/usr/bin/claude` → `/usr/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code`). **There is no native-installer path** (re-verified live on the host 2026-07-22).
**Pin (single source of truth):** `CC_VERSION` in `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`, which
also exports the shared **`cc_ensure_local`** aligner. Sourced by `scripts/install.sh`,
`scripts/host-setup.sh`, `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, and `scripts/update.sh`. Bump it in one
place; the next `install.sh`/`bootstrap.sh`/`update.sh` run aligns the **container's**
own Claude Code to the pin via `cc_ensure_local` (installs when absent AND upgrades/
downgrades a drifted-but-present CC — the earlier scripts only installed when CC was
*missing*, so a bumped pin never reached an already-installed container). `update.sh`
additionally syncs the **host VM** via the guardian `update-cc` op (see "Updating Claude
Code" below).
**Minimum required by Genesis:** intentionally **not enforced** at runtime (all current code works with 2.0+). A managed-settings `requiredMinimumVersion` floor (`/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`, Linux-only — never read from user/project `settings.json`) was evaluated and **deliberately rejected**: a hard floor removes the incident-recovery downgrade path the project has actually used (the 2.1.90→2.1.87 scrollback rollback) and can brick CC if the floor is written above the installed version. Drift is prevented instead by the npm pin + `cc_ensure_local` (aligns the local CC to the pin on every install/bootstrap/update — exact-match, so a downgrade pin also applies) + the unified `update-cc` updater for the host + `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`/`DISABLE_UPDATES` (so CC never self-bumps).

## Updating Claude Code (host + container)

One pin, both machines, no drift. **`origin` is the PUBLIC repo, so merging the pin *is* the
release** — which makes the pin PR the wrong place to discover a regression. The sequence below
is therefore the WHOLE procedure, gates first: **editing the pin is step 6, not step 1.** A bump
that starts at step 6 has skipped both mandatory gates and is a process violation.

**The two mandatory gates are:** (1) the **full changelog read** over `(pinned, target]` — step 1 /
checklist step 0; and (2) the **local-first soak** of the candidate on the container — steps 3–5.
Neither is waivable.

### Gate receipts — what "recorded" actually means

A gate that is only asserted is not a gate. Each one has a named receipt, a defined place to write
it, and a defined meaning when it is absent. **A missing receipt is read as "not run"** — not as
"probably fine, they just forgot to write it down".

| Gate | Receipt (PR-body trailer) | Also recorded in | Absent ⇒ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full changelog read (step 1) | `CC-Gate-Changelog: read (X, Y] in full from <source>, <date>` | a **closed** ledger row, plus a "changelog read" clause in the new row's **Action Taken** cell | blocking at merge |
| Candidate validation + soak (steps 3–5) | `CC-Gate-Soak: <candidate> on container <start>..<end>, check_cc_running_versions.sh clean, sign-off recorded` | the same row's **Action Taken** cell | blocking at merge |

Both clauses go in **Action Taken** — §Version History has no dedicated column for them and is not
gaining one (~40 historical rows would all need a blank cell). Action Taken is already the prose
column, and existing rows narrate outcomes there.

`<source>` in the changelog receipt must be an upstream URL or a bare filename
(`CHANGELOG.md`, `gh release view`) — **never a local path**. The scratch copy the checklist tells
you to fetch lives under a home directory, and PR bodies are public.

Both trailers follow the repo's existing `Ledger:` / `Follow-up:` PR-body convention, and the
`cc-pin-receipts` check (`scripts/check_cc_pin_receipts.py`) blocks a pin-forward PR that is missing
either. Downgrades are exempt by construction — a rollback returns to a version
that already ran here, and the downgrade path is this project's incident-recovery
route.

Be clear-eyed about what that buys: the receipts prove the gates were not **forgotten**. Nothing in
CI can prove they were actually *run* — a receipt is as forgeable as any other self-attestation,
which is why `review-depth-check` is advisory by design. The soak receipt names
`check_cc_running_versions.sh` specifically because that one *is* checkable after the fact: it
reports which live processes were really on the candidate, and a soak whose sessions were not is
evidence about the previous release.

*Why the soak needed its own receipt (2026-08-27):* every concrete recording requirement here used
to attach to the changelog read alone. A pin PR could therefore satisfy every reviewable receipt
while skipping steps 3–5 entirely — so the "unwaivable" local-first gate was not, in fact,
checkable before merging the public pin.

**Pick the target first.** `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code version` gives `latest`; use an
explicit older version if you are deliberately not chasing latest. Every step below is defined over
`(pinned, target]`, so nothing can start until `target` is fixed — and re-picking it later restarts
the procedure (step 5).

1. **Evaluate — run the EVALUATION half of §CC Update Evaluation Checklist: its steps 0–6.**
   (Checklist steps 7–8 are *post-update* by their own wording — "run integration tests after
   update", "update this document with findings" — so they belong at steps 9–10 here, not now.)
   Checklist **step 0 is the MANDATORY full-changelog-read gate**: every release entry in
   `(pinned, target]`, read in full, recorded as a durable row. No pin bump proceeds without it.
   The analyzer's verdict is TRIAGE — it prioritises, it does not discharge the gate.
   - **Take the PRE-align model-alias sample HERE, in step 1** — while the old binary is still
     installed. Not in step 2: that step has a legitimate skip condition, and a sample nested under
     it vanishes silently exactly when the skip fires, leaving step 4's "after" reading with nothing
     to compare against. It cannot move later either — step 3 replaces the CLI. See §Model-alias
     drift in the `cc-update` skill for the invocation and which `modelUsage` entry to read.
2. **Deploy current `main` FIRST — before the soak, never during it.** Run `scripts/update.sh`
   (background task) so the box is on current code *before* the candidate goes on. Two reasons:
   a long gap between deploys means step 8 would otherwise land weeks of Genesis change **and**
   the CC bump in one shot, leaving you unable to attribute a regression to either; and the soak
   is only meaningful as evidence about CC if the code underneath it isn't stale.
   **Checkable skip condition — three parts, all required:**
   1. `git fetch origin` **first.** `origin/main` is a remote-tracking ref that only moves when you
      fetch; comparing against a stale one produces a false "already current".
   2. Take the newest `update_history_recent` row **whose `status == "success"`**. The tool returns
      every attempt — `success`, `failure`, `rolled_back` alike (`update_history.py:98-113`) — so an
      unfiltered "newest row" can be a failed or rolled-back attempt whose later timestamp reads as
      evidence of a deployment that never landed.
   3. Confirm that row's `new_commit` contains the freshly-fetched `origin/main` head — i.e. the
      head is an ancestor of (or equal to) the deployed commit. Mechanically:
      `git merge-base --is-ancestor "$(git rev-parse origin/main)" <new_commit>` exits 0.
      Timestamps are not the test; "newer" is not a containment relation.

   Skip only if all three hold. "It feels recent" is not the test; a 2-week gap is easy to
   accumulate and invisible without looking. (`update.sh` re-aligns the container to the repo pin,
   which is exactly right *here* — it is the same property that makes it destructive mid-soak at
   step 5.) If the MCP server is unavailable, the same rows are readable from the dashboard's
   deploy history, or directly from the `update_history` table.
3. **Align the CONTAINER ONLY to the candidate.** Set the candidate ONCE as a standalone
   assignment, then run both functions under it:

   ```bash
   source scripts/lib/cc_version.sh   # NOTE: this sets CC_VERSION to the repo PIN (cc_version.sh:20)
   CC_VERSION=<candidate>             # standalone assignment, AFTER the source
   cc_ensure_local
   cc_shadow_scan
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Do NOT write `CC_VERSION=<candidate> cc_ensure_local` and then a bare `cc_shadow_scan`.**
   > A variable-assignment *prefix* on a **function** call does not persist past that call
   > (measured: the prefix value is visible inside the function and reverts immediately after), and
   > `source` has already set `CC_VERSION` to the repo pin. The scan would therefore run with the
   > OLD pin while the container is on the candidate. That is not a harmless no-op: if any copy is
   > still at the old pin, `cc_shadow_scan` crowns **that** one canonical and `_cc_remove_shadow`
   > (`cc_version.sh:251`) **deletes the freshly-installed candidate** — silently reverting the soak
   > and removing the machine's primary `claude`. If no copy matches, it prints "REFUSING to remove
   > anything" (`cc_version.sh:209`) and returns 0, so a broken invocation also *looks* successful.

   `cc_shadow_scan` matters here because a second nvm/native/user-prefix copy on a different
   interactive PATH has bitten this project repeatedly — without it the whole soak can exercise a
   stale shadow binary while the same-shell version check passes. (`update.sh:477-488` pairs the
   two the same way, but `unset`s `CC_VERSION` first so both run on the pin.)
   `cc_ensure_local` is **container-only**, so the host stays on the pin — a live rollback path.

   **Do not verify with `claude --version` alone — it cannot answer this question.** It spawns a
   *fresh child*, which reads the new on-disk binary and truthfully reports the candidate while the
   session that asked is still executing the old one. Run
   `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` (the running-binary sweep), which
   compares each live process's actual mapped binary against the one on disk.
   - **Check the candidate's Node floor BEFORE aligning** —
     `npm view @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<candidate> engines.node` against the container's
     `node -v`. **If the floor rises above the container's Node, STOP: there is no container-side
     Node transition tool today.** Every `NODE_MAJOR` consumer is either a CI assertion
     (`check_cc_node_lockstep.py`) or a dispatch to the **host** via the guardian `update-node` op
     (`update.sh:441`, `cc_align_host.sh`); the only container-side Node installer
     (`install.sh:473-477` `_node_version_ok`) gates on a hardcoded `>= 20` and never reads
     `NODE_MAJOR`. Treat a rising floor as prerequisite work, not something to improvise here.
   - **A failed align is NOT a clean no-op.** `cc_ensure_local` runs `npm install -g` and only
     *then* verifies `claude --version` (`cc_version.sh:132-149`), so an incompatible candidate has
     **already replaced the working CC**; the verify merely downgrades the outcome to a warning and
     `return 1`. Recover immediately with the step-5 rollback:
     `source scripts/lib/cc_version.sh && CC_VERSION=<pin> cc_ensure_local`.
4. **Validate the candidate — pre-soak expectations differ from post-merge.** During the soak the
   correct state is **container == candidate, host == old pin** (NOT the step-9 "both == pin"
   check, which cannot pass yet). Run the critical paths, this doc's §Known Issues, and every
   behavior the impact eval flagged. Note that any Guardian-path check exercises the **host's old
   binary**, so candidate-specific Guardian behavior needs a container-side exercise instead.
   - **Run `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` FIRST.** Validation performed inside a session
     still mapped to the replaced binary is evidence about the OLD release — and it is the evidence
     the changelog gate feeds into. The check belongs at every point that produces evidence about
     the candidate (steps 3, 4, 5 and 9), not only at the soak boundary.
   - **Take the POST-align model-alias sample** and compare it against the pre-align one from step
     1. Nothing else in the system detects an alias remap: it is not a downgrade, so the tier-based
     downgrade detector is blind to it.
5. **Soak 2–3 days** under real use — and **the clock does not start until every interactive
   session is actually running the candidate.** Relaunch the foreground sessions, then prove it:
   `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` must exit 0 before the clock starts, and again at soak
   end. A process that predates the align keeps its original binary mapping until it restarts, so
   it contributes evidence about the OLD release for the entire soak.

   *This is not hypothetical (measured on a live install):* a soak ran its full length with **a
   majority of live CC processes — and most interactive sessions — still executing the replaced
   predecessor**. `cc_shadow_scan` was clean the whole time — it scans on-disk copies, not running
   processes — and `claude --version` reported the candidate throughout.
   Record the sweep result in the `CC-Gate-Soak` receipt.

   **Do NOT run `update.sh` during the soak** — it `unset`s any
   inherited `CC_VERSION` and re-aligns the container to the repo pin, reverting the candidate.
   Rollback at any time is one command:
   `source scripts/lib/cc_version.sh && CC_VERSION=<pin> cc_ensure_local`.
   - **Mid-soak drift.** CC ships ~daily, so `latest` *will* move. Re-target mid-cycle **only if**
     the newer release fixes something touching our workflow / soak safety / a known issue (e.g.
     2.1.245→246 fixed a background-retention sweep that reaped user-created `.claude/worktrees/`).
     Otherwise finish the soak on the current target and roll the delta into the next cycle —
     never silently chase-latest.
   - **A re-target RESTARTS this procedure from step 1 for the new target.** The prior durable
     changelog-gate row no longer covers the range, step-4 validation was run against a different
     binary, and the soak clock resets. Continuing the original schedule would publish a target
     that received only hours of real use — defeating the gate precisely for the
     workflow-affecting releases that justify re-targeting in the first place.
6. **Only after a clean soak + explicit user sign-off: bump the pin** — edit `CC_VERSION` in
   `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh` (one line). If the new CC version raises its `engines.node` floor,
   bump `NODE_MAJOR` in the same file in lockstep — the `cc-node-lockstep` CI job
   (`scripts/check_cc_node_lockstep.py`) fails the PR if `NODE_MAJOR` is below the pinned CC's
   required Node major, so this can't be forgotten (it fails open on a transient npm-registry
   error). Add the §Version History row, including the changelog-gate clause from step 1.
7. **PR → CI green** (incl. `cc-node-lockstep`) → **privacy scan** (`origin`
   is public — run the pre-push privacy scanners over the diff) → **explicit user approval** →
   **squash-merge**. Then `git pull --rebase origin main`.
   **Put both gate receipts in the PR body** (§Gate receipts above) — the merge gate blocks the
   PR without them:
   ```
   CC-Gate-Changelog: read (2.1.218, 2.1.246] in full from CHANGELOG.md, 2026-08-27
   CC-Gate-Soak: 2.1.246 on container 2026-08-25..2026-08-27, check_cc_running_versions.sh clean, sign-off recorded
   ```
8. **Run `scripts/update.sh`** (a background task — deploys exceed the Bash tool timeout). It
   updates the container, redeploys the Guardian (carrying the new gateway script), then queries
   the host's CC version and — **only if it differs from the pin** — dispatches `update-cc <pin>`
   to the Guardian gateway on the host. The dispatch is idempotent (acts only on drift) and
   non-fatal **to the deploy** — but "non-fatal" is not "harmless", and it does NOT mean the
   host still has a working CC. The gateway runs `npm install -g` **before** it verifies
   (`guardian-gateway.sh`, the `update-cc` op), so the two failure states differ:
   if the install itself fails, the previous package is untouched; if the install succeeds
   and the version check then fails, the old package is **already replaced and there is no
   rollback**. That second state leaves the Guardian's `claude -p` recovery brain without a
   working CLI while the deploy reports success, so treat a failed host update as an
   incident to resolve in the same session — verify the host directly (step 9) rather than
   assuming the previous version survived.
   Between updates the nightly `genesis-cc-align.timer` closes **host** drift only —
   `scripts/cc_align_host.sh` calls `cc_align_host_sync` and never `cc_ensure_local`, so container
   drift does **not** self-heal nightly. The useful corollary: that timer will not silently revert
   a container candidate during the step-5 soak.
9. **Post-deploy validation in the SAME session.** Container **and** host `claude --version` ==
   pin (host via a FRESH gateway `version` op — **not** `~/.genesis/host_gateway_state.json`,
   which `cc_align_host_sync` writes from its PRE-alignment probe and never refreshes after
   dispatching `update-cc`, so it still reports the OLD version until the nightly timer runs);
   guardian tick
   healthy; a headless `claude -p` smoke on a **FRESH** process; re-check §Known Issues and any
   tabled CC bugs against the new version; and verify each behavior the impact eval flagged on the
   live path, not just that the flag still parses.
   Run `scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` here too: after `update.sh` replaces the binary,
   every session open across the deploy is still mapped to the previous one, so post-deploy
   validation done in an un-relaunched session re-checks the version you just moved away from.
   **Confirm the pin can still hold.** `update.sh` re-asserts auto-updater suppression
   automatically (via `cc_ensure_local` → `cc_ensure_updater_suppressed`), so watch its output for
   a `! CC auto-updater suppression was MISSING` line — that means something on this machine
   rewrote `~/.claude/settings.json`, and a repeat is worth investigating rather than letting it
   be silently re-repaired every run. To check by hand on either machine:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json,os;p=os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/settings.json');e=(json.load(open(p)) if os.path.exists(p) else {}).get('env',{});print({k:e.get(k) for k in ('DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER','DISABLE_UPDATES')})"
   ```
   Both must read `1`. A missing file, or either key `None`, means **not suppressed** — and a pin
   with an un-suppressed auto-updater is not a pin. See §Auto-Updater Suppression Requires
   User-Level Settings.
10. **Leverage + capture.** For each newly-available capability Genesis would want, file the
    detection→behavior follow-up. Store what was learned to memory + this doc + the KB so the next
    update executes rather than rediscovers.

The host install runs through the gateway's `update-cc <semver>` op
(`scripts/guardian-gateway.sh`): it validates the argument as a bare semver,
installs `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>` using the npm that owns the in-use
`claude` (so the global prefix matches the binary the Guardian resolves via its
baked `command -v claude` path), and verifies `claude --version` afterward.

To move the host by hand:
`ssh -i ~/.ssh/genesis_guardian_ed25519 <host_user>@<host_ip> "update-cc <pin>"` (use the exact `CC_VERSION` from `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`, e.g. `update-cc 2.1.246`)

**Incident downgrade:** because there is no `requiredMinimumVersion` floor, the
host (or container) can be rolled back to an older known-good version the same way
(`update-cc <older>`) if a release regresses — exactly what the 2.1.90→2.1.87
rollback needed.

### One-canonical-copy policy (`cc_shadow_scan`)

The pin machinery only manages ONE copy of Claude Code per machine. Any second
copy drifts silently and eventually shadows the pinned one in some PATH context
— four real incidents in one week (2026-07): an nvm-tree copy that won
interactive PATH and showed a months-old version; a native-installer symlink in
`~/.local/bin` doing the same; ~490MB of leftover native version blobs; and a
user-prefix copy invisible to non-interactive shells, which made the updater
"reinstall" CC on every run AND silently skipped MCP registration.

`cc_shadow_scan` (in `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`, run by install/bootstrap/
update/host-setup; mirrored compactly in the gateway's `update-cc` op for the
host) enforces the policy. The canonical copy is **pin-verified**: the first
copy (PATH resolution, then `CC_PROBE_DIRS`) that actually reports
`CC_VERSION` — never a bare `command -v`, because an interactive PATH can put
a stale copy first, and crowning that one would delete the good copy.
**Fail-safe: if no copy at the pin exists anywhere, nothing is removed.**
Every other copy on a known surface (nvm trees, `~/.claude/local`,
`~/.local/bin`, native version blobs, stale npm prefixes) is removed — but
only when provably a claude-code install; the canonical's own package dir is
never removed (a stale second link into it loses only the link), a
native-install canonical keeps its versions dir, and anything ambiguous is
warned about and left alone, as are `alias claude=` lines in rc files
(detected, never edited). The gateway variant is user-dir-only (it never
sudo-removes) and runs only after its post-install verify proves the pin.
Deliberate multi-copy setups: `CC_SHADOW_SCAN=0` opts out.

`cc_ensure_local` also probes known prefixes (`CC_PROBE_DIRS`) before declaring
CC "not installed", so a PATH-blind install is aligned in place instead of
reinstalled forever.

### The pin PR's own gate: `cc-pin-receipts`

A change moving `CC_VERSION` **forward** must carry both gate receipts as
PR-body trailers, in the same style as the repo's existing `Ledger:` /
`Follow-up:` trailers:

```
CC-Gate-Changelog: read (<from>, <to>] in full from <source>, <date>
CC-Gate-Soak: <candidate> on <where> <start>..<end>, running-binary sweep <result>, signed off <who>
```

Write them in the PR body itself. Receipts inside an HTML comment or a code
fence do **not** count — they satisfy a text search while being invisible to the
person merging, and the only enforcement this has is a human reading a claim
someone chose to make. Ordinary markdown is fine: list bullets, `- [x]` task
boxes, blockquotes and bold all work.

**Receipts are also required when the direction cannot be established.** The gate
compares the pin the PR will publish against the pin on the base branch. If the
base branch's pin is unreadable — the file is missing, empty, carries no
`CC_VERSION` assignment, or assigns it more than once — there is nothing to
compare against, and the gate asks for the receipts *in place of* the comparison.

The same applies when the base pin is present but **not installable**, such as a
leading-zero version like `2.1.0250`. `npm install` cannot resolve that spelling,
so it is not evidence that any version ever ran here — and the *unchanged* and
*backward* exemptions both rest on exactly that claim.

**Write the receipts where GitHub renders them.** They may sit on the same line
as one of the template's `<!-- -->` prompts — the check reads what the rendered
body shows. Receipts *inside* a comment or a code fence still do not count: the
only enforcement here is a human reading a claim someone chose to make, and a
receipt the reviewer cannot see defeats it.

This is the case a PR that **repairs** a broken pin file will hit, and the ask is
deliberate: such a PR is establishing a pin rather than restoring a known one,
and it is invisible to CI, because its merge tree contains the repaired file and
`cc-node-lockstep` therefore passes. The receipts are a line in the PR body, so
this refuses a merge, never the repository's ability to repair itself.

A *transport* failure reading the base — an API timeout, an unresolvable ref — is
not the same thing and stays non-blocking, with a note printed at merge time.

**A PR that does not edit `scripts/lib/cc_version.sh` is never asked for
receipts**, whatever state the pin is in on either side. That is settled from the
PR's own changed-file list, which GitHub computes against the merge base, so a PR
that merely branched before the pin last changed is not mistaken for one that
edits it.

Two more rules follow from the pin being **published** by the merge, since
`origin` is the public repo:

* The head pin must be canonical `X.Y.Z` with no leading zeros **whenever this PR
  wrote it** — `npm install @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.0218` does not resolve.
  A non-canonical pin *inherited* unchanged from the base is not blocked; that
  would make one bad commit block every open PR, including its own repair.
* A pin that is present but unreadable at the head — unparseable, ambiguous, over
  GitHub's 1MB inline limit — blocks. "I cannot tell what this PR pins" is not a
  reason to wave a release through.

**The merge gate is the authority; CI is advisory.** The check reads the PR
BODY, which stays mutable after any CI run finishes, so a CI status describing
it is a claim about the past. It therefore runs at merge time
(`scripts/hooks/git_push_guard.py --check-pr`), comparing the pin at the PR head
against the pin on `origin/main` — which at that moment is exactly what the pin
is about to land on. The `cc-pin-receipts` job in `ci.yml` runs the same checker
with `--advisory`: it annotates a missing receipt early and always exits 0.

That split is deliberate, and reversing it breaks the gate. A completed check
run is immutable, and the merge gate treats a stale FAILURE as red on purpose —
it forces `gh pr merge --admin` and is the sole CI enforcement for the merges it
allows, so a later SUCCESS clearing an earlier FAILURE would make re-running a
job until green sufficient to merge. A *blocking* status over a mutable input
therefore could not be cleared by fixing that input: the author would have to
push a commit purely to get a fresh head. Running from main's copy of the
checker also means a PR cannot edit the code that gates it.

Scope, stated plainly: it stops **omission, not forgery**. Nothing here can tell
whether a soak actually happened — this repo already settled that question,
which is why `review-depth-check` is advisory by design. What it converts is
*forgetting* into *consciously writing something untrue*. Same kind of check,
and the same strength, as `scripts/check_hook_versions_complete.sh`.

It compares the **parsed pin value**, not whether the file changed, so PRs that
edit `cc_version.sh` for other reasons are unaffected. **Downgrades are
auto-exempt** — a rollback returns to a version that already ran here, and the
downgrade path is this project's incident-recovery route (the reason a managed
`requiredMinimumVersion` floor was rejected above). No override syntax to
remember under incident pressure.

What it will **not** do is guess. A pin it cannot read — absent, assigned more
than once, not canonical semver, or not valid UTF-8 — **blocks**. "I cannot tell
what this file pins" is not a reason to publish a release; it is the state a
human needs to look at.

### Which copy is INSTALLED vs which copy is RUNNING

Different questions, different checks, and a box can pass one while failing the
other.

`cc_shadow_scan` answers **installed**: it probes `command -v claude` plus
`CC_PROBE_DIRS` for extra on-disk copies and removes the stale ones.

`scripts/check_cc_running_versions.sh` answers **running**: for every live CC
process it resolves `stat -L /proc/<pid>/exe` — procfs keeps that reference
valid even after npm unlinks the file — and compares its **device + inode**
against the binary on disk today. Device matters: an inode number is unique only
within a filesystem, so copies on separate mounts can collide numerically.

Measured on a live install: exactly one canonical binary, at the intended
version, while **a majority of live CC sessions were still executing the
replaced predecessor**. A long-running process keeps its original mapping until
it restarts, and `claude --version` cannot reveal this — it spawns a *fresh
child*, which reads the new on-disk binary and truthfully reports the new
version while the session asking the question is not running it.

This matters most during a local-first soak, whose whole premise is that real
interactive use exercises the candidate. Run the sweep at soak start and again
at soak end.

**The rule it is built around**, because a check that produces release evidence
has one failure that matters more than the others:

> Any process the sweep cannot POSITIVELY PROVE is not-Claude-Code must not
> contribute to a clean verdict.

Positive proof is cheap: a readable executable whose basename is not a Claude
Code name, or an unreadable executable whose command line's `argv[0]` is not
one. Only when neither can be read is a process genuinely unclassifiable, and
that refuses the clean verdict rather than being skipped. Measured on a live
box, that bucket holds 0 of 109 processes — the rule costs nothing in practice
and never launders a false all-clear.

Classification is a **closed set of names**, never a path guess. An earlier
design classified by whether the executable lived under an enumerated install
root; it fails on the only case that matters, because npm's replace renames the
old package aside and then deletes it, so a stale process's path points at a
directory that no longer exists. A root set enumerated from the install cannot
contain a directory the installer deleted, so exactly the stale processes would
have been classified "not CC", ignored, and reported clean.

Exit codes: **0** every live CC process runs the on-disk binary; **1** at least
one runs a different binary — either a replaced one, or an installed copy that
is not the PATH-canonical one (each named, so `cc_shadow_scan` can resolve it);
**2** cannot determine, so no clean verdict is claimed. A node-wrapped install
resolves `exe` to the interpreter, whose inode says nothing about which CC
revision is loaded, so it reports undetermined rather than a false all-clear.
The same is true under a `hidepid` procfs, where other users' processes are not
enumerable at all and the denominator itself would be unverified.

## CC Features — Usage Status

### Actively Used
- CLI non-interactive mode (`-p`)
- Background session dispatch with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- System prompt injection (`--system-prompt`, `--append-system-prompt`) — all background session paths use `--append-system-prompt`
- Effort levels (`--effort`)
- Tool blacklisting (`--disallowedTools`) and whitelisting (`--allowedTools`)
- MCP config per session (`--mcp-config`)
- Session resume (`--resume`)
- Bare mode (`--bare`)
- Turn limits (`--max-turns`) and strict MCP config (`--strict-mcp-config`) for Guardian diagnosis
- PreToolUse / PostToolUse / SessionStart / Stop / UserPromptSubmit hooks

#### Hook input contract (load-bearing — a silent-failure class)

CC passes each hook its payload as **JSON on stdin**
(`{"tool_name": ..., "tool_input": {...}, "tool_response": {...}, "session_id": ...}`).
The `CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT` / `CLAUDE_TOOL_USE_RESULT` / `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` **env
vars are a dead legacy contract** — current CC does not set them. A hook that
reads them sees an empty value and **fails open silently**. This went unnoticed
because the hooks' own tests fed the dead env var and passed against an interface
CC no longer uses (2026-07-23: `git push`, `rm -rf`, worktree `pip install -e`,
and CRITICAL-path writes were all unguarded; every guard's block *logic* was
fine — only the input read was dead).

Genesis hooks read input through `scripts/hooks/hook_input.py`
(`read_payload()` / `field()` / `tool_response()` / `session_id()`), which reads
stdin, extracts the `tool_input`-nested fields, and warns on a malformed payload
so a broken contract can't silently fail open again.

#### Hook OUTPUT: a decision channel and a context channel, capped differently

These are separate, and conflating them produces a plausible-but-wrong safety
worry. CC **files** a hook's stdout above a per-hook-entry size cap (10,000
characters on 2.1.246 — version-volatile; it sat near the high-20s K on 2.1.218)
and shows the model a ~2 KB preview. That cap governs stdout as **model-visible
context**.

It does **not** gate the control-plane parse of `hookSpecificOutput`. A
PreToolUse `deny` is parsed and honoured however long its
`permissionDecisionReason` is — so an oversized reason does **not** cause the
gate to fail open.

MEASURED 2026-09-03 on CC 2.1.246, via `claude -p --settings <probe>` with a
PreToolUse hook emitting a `deny` whose reason length was varied, discriminating
on a **disk side effect** (the denied command writes a marker file) rather than
on wording:

| reason chars | hook stdout bytes | marker written | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| 500 | 617 | no | BLOCKED (control) |
| 15,000 | 15,117 | no | BLOCKED |
| 200,000 | 200,117 | no | BLOCKED |

The small-reason control arm is load-bearing: without it, "not blocked" at the
large size is indistinguishable from a probe that never worked. In all three
arms the reason also reached the model, so it is not silently discarded.

Two cautions. **Re-measure both numbers after a CC pin bump** — the stdout cap
has already moved once across a version bump, and this one could too. And do not
transfer either result to the other channel, or to a tool result: per-tool
`maxResultSizeChars` is a third budget again.

Genesis's own gates are unaffected either way: every blocking hook uses **exit
code 2 with the reason on stderr**, whose verdict comes from the exit status and
therefore cannot be weakened by a long reason. `permissionDecision` appears in
the tree only as `allow` and `ask`. The measurement matters for any future hook
that denies via JSON.

`session_id` is a special case: a dozen hooks interpolate it into a filesystem
path (`~/.genesis/sessions/<id>/`), and several `mkdir(parents=True)` — so an id
carrying `/` or `..` would not merely read the wrong file, it would CREATE
directories outside the session tree. `is_safe_session_id()` is the source of truth for
hooks under `scripts/` (allow-list `\A[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,255}\Z`, deliberately
wider than the hex-UUID shape CC usually emits — the observed id set already
contains other shapes), and `session_id()` refuses to return a value that fails
it. The 255 is the filesystem's own single-name limit, not a policy choice: every
character the pattern admits is one byte in UTF-8, and a tighter bound would
reject ids that are valid path components and that the hand-rolled checks this
replaced accepted.

It is NOT yet repo-wide: the helper lives in `scripts/hooks/`, which
`src/genesis/**` can only reach through a `sys.path` insert, so several `src/`
sites (and a handful of hooks) still carry their own hand-written check. Moving
the validator to an importable home and adding a CI scan that fails on a new raw
`sessions/<id>` join is tracked separately — until then, treat this as the hook
contract, not a repo-wide invariant.

Build session paths with `session_path(base, sid, *parts)` rather than joining
the id yourself: it returns `None` for an unsafe id, so the caller skips exactly
the filesystem operation. That matters because the id is dangerous ONLY as a
path component — a rejection must not gate DB lookups (the id is a bound
parameter there), payload-only logic, or canonical writes.
`tests/test_scripts/test_hook_input_contract.py` feeds each guard a real payload
and statically forbids any hook from reading a dead payload env var. See
`.claude/hooks/README.md` for the authoring rule. **A CC bump that changes the
hook payload shape must re-run that test** (checklist item below).

### Planned to Use (Phase 6-7)
- **Skills system** — Load Genesis skills into CC background sessions
- **Hooks in frontmatter** (CC 2.1) — Per-session hook configuration via session_config.py
- **Forked skill context** (CC 2.1) — Skill isolation in background sessions
- **Wildcard permissions** (CC 2.1) — `Bash(*-h*)` style permission patterns
- **Hot reload** (CC 2.1) — Skill updates without session restart

### Evaluated — Not Using
- **Scheduled tasks** (CC 2.0) — Genesis uses APScheduler instead. CC scheduled tasks
  are desktop-only and less sophisticated than our depth-classified awareness loop.
  Re-evaluate if CC adds server-side scheduled tasks.
- **`/teleport` to claude.ai/code** — Not relevant for server-side Genesis.
- **Shift+Enter for newlines** — UX feature, no Genesis impact.
- **`MCP_CONNECTION_NONBLOCKING=true`** (CC 2.1.89) — Skips MCP connection wait
  entirely in `-p` mode. Too aggressive for Genesis — most background sessions
  need MCP tools early (ego queries health, reflection uses memory). The automatic
  5s connection bound (also 2.1.89) provides sufficient timeout safety without
  opt-in. Revisit if background sessions show >5s MCP hangs.

### Not Yet Evaluated
- **`defer` permission decision** (CC 2.1.89) — PreToolUse hooks can return
  `"defer"` to pause headless sessions at a tool call. Session resumes via
  `--resume` with hook re-evaluation. Potential building block for earned
  autonomy pipeline: hook returns `defer` on high-risk operations, Guardian
  approves, session resumes. Evaluate when autonomy work (gap closure roadmap)
  progresses.
- **`PermissionDenied` hook** (CC 2.1.89) — Fires after auto mode classifier
  denials. Return `{retry: true}` to tell the model it can retry. Not relevant
  while background sessions use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. Evaluate if
  we move to auto mode + hooks.
- **Agent denial doesn't stop** (CC 2.1) — May affect CCInvoker error handling
- **Model language configuration** — Potentially useful for multi-language user support
- **Session moves** (CC 2.1) — Could enable session migration between terminals

## CC Update Evaluation Checklist

When a new CC version is released, run through this:

0. **FULL CHANGELOG READ — MANDATORY GATE, NO EXCEPTIONS.** Read EVERY release entry
   in `(pinned, target]` **in full** before any triage. No pin bump proceeds without it.
   - **Fetch it fresh — nothing in Genesis maintains a changelog cache:**
     `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-code/main/CHANGELOG.md -o ~/tmp/cc_changelog.md`
     (that path is a scratch copy, NOT a recon-pulled cache; `mkdir -p ~/tmp` first —
     `curl -f` will not create it). **Before reading, confirm the file CONTAINS a
     `## <target>` heading** (`grep -c '^## <target>$'`). That one check is what a stale
     copy fails. Do NOT *also* require the FIRST heading to equal the target: under the
     mid-soak rule (§Updating step 5) you may deliberately finish on a target that
     `latest` has already passed, and equality would then be unsatisfiable by any
     re-fetch. ("First heading ≥ target" is not worth checking either — the upstream file
     is newest-first, so a present target heading already implies it.)
   - **Escape hatch: a target released hours ago may not be in `main`'s CHANGELOG.md yet** —
     the one case where no re-fetch can satisfy the check. Cover the missing tail from the
     GitHub release bodies — but **enumerate it first**: `gh release view` reads ONE release,
     so `gh release view v<target>` alone under-reads whenever more than one release in
     `(pinned, target]` is absent from the file, and the gate then closes over releases
     nobody read. List what is actually missing and fetch each one:
     ```bash
     gh release list --repo anthropics/claude-code --limit 60 --json tagName -q '.[].tagName'
     # keep the tags in (pinned, target] that have no `## <version>` heading in the file,
     # then for EACH:  gh release view <tag> --repo anthropics/claude-code
     ```
     Record in the durable row which source covered which releases. Do not silently proceed
     on a file that lacks the target.
   - Scale: `(2.1.218, 2.1.246]` measured **25 releases / ~88KB**. The load-bearing
     item can sit anywhere, **including deep inside the newest release**.
   - **`recon_cc_update_check` is a TRIAGE SUMMARY — never a substitute for this
     read.** It prioritises; it does not discharge the gate.
   - **Mark the gate done as a durable row**, not a chat line:
     `session_ledger_add(session_id=<this session>, text=…)` — `session_id` is REQUIRED — with `"CC changelog gate: read (2.1.X, 2.1.Y] in full from <source>, <date>"`,
     and carry that string into the PR body and the §Version History row added at
     §Updating **step 6** (before the PR, not after it).
     For rows added **from 2026-08-26 onward**, a Version-History row without that
     clause means the gate was not run — treat it as blocking at merge. Older rows
     predate the gate and are not retroactively in scope.
   - **Delegation is allowed only with the same context and rigor** — brief the
     sub-agent with the Genesis impact-surface list (see §Delegating the full
     changelog read in `.claude/skills/cc-update/SKILL.md`), then adversarially
     spot-check its load-bearing findings against ground truth before trusting them.
   - **Verify COVERAGE, not just accuracy.** Spot-checking what the delegate returned
     can only catch wrong findings — it cannot detect releases it never read. A
     subagent that hits its turn limit now returns **partial** output without failing
     (CC 2.1.246), so a silent early stop looks exactly like a clean short report.
     Before marking the gate done: enumerate every `## ` release heading in
     `(pinned, target]` from the file itself, and reconcile that list against an
     explicit per-release acknowledgement from the delegate. An unreconciled release
     means the gate is NOT done, however good the findings look.
   - *Origin (2026-08-26):* a session re-targeted 2.1.245→246 on the headline delta
     and let the changelog-*reading* analyzer stand in for actually reading the
     changelog. The cause was **mechanical, not merely human**: the analyzer fetches
     only the newest 5 GitHub releases, keeps just the `new` version's body, and
     truncates it at 1000 chars — v2.1.246's body is ~9.3KB, so it saw roughly the
     first 8 of ~60 bullets and could not have surfaced the rest. The later full read
     found real 246 items the triage missed: subagent `maxTurns` now returns partial
     output; `-p --continue`/`--resume` plan-mode resume; and a `--strict-mcp-config`
     startup-hang fix that lands directly on Guardian Diagnosis.
1. **Triage what the read surfaced:** classify each entry from step 0 as
   RISK / GAIN / LEVERAGE, with its release number. `recon_cc_update_check` assists
   here — it is not the source.
2. **8-lens evaluation:** Check each change against: programmatic integration,
   hooks/permissions, MCP/tools, interactive CLI experience, performance/stability,
   security/trust, platform/environment, model/API. (See `_ANALYSIS_PROMPT` in
   `src/genesis/recon/cc_update_analyzer.py` for the full lens definitions.)
3. **Flag/API changes:** Are any CLI flags we use modified or deprecated?
4. **New capabilities:** Does this unlock something we're working around?
   **Detection → behavior:** for each new skill/command/flag Genesis would
   plausibly WANT (overlaps an existing workflow, replaces a hand-rolled
   mechanism, covers a known gap), do not stop at the informational KB note —
   file a GitHub ISSUE (mechanics: `.claude/docs/mcp-tools-guide.md`) naming
   the SPECIFIC instruction change that would make Genesis actually reach for
   it (which skill/CLAUDE.md line to edit, and any precedence decision vs
   existing skills) — that edit is repo work, so it belongs on the public
   tracker. Keep a local `blocked_on_trigger` row alongside it when the
   change waits on a version pin, with a `revisit_condition` naming the pin (the
   tool hard-errors without one); the tracker has no revisit mechanism.
   A detected-but-unwired capability is never used.
   (Origin: the 2026-08 `/design` research-preview announcement.)
5. **Obsolescence check:** Does this make something we built unnecessary?
6. **Interactive UX check:** Does this change the foreground session experience?
   Rendering, scrollback, terminal behavior, keyboard shortcuts?
7. **Test impact:** Run Genesis CC integration tests after update. **Always run
   `pytest tests/test_scripts/test_hook_input_contract.py`** — it feeds each
   safety guard a real payload, so it catches a changed hook payload shape that
   would otherwise silently disable the guards (see the hook input contract
   under "Actively Used" above).
8. **Re-probe the `AskUserQuestion` rewrite path.** The gate-menu substitution
   (`scripts/hooks/ask_gate_menu.py`) rests on `updatedInput` rewriting an
   `AskUserQuestion` call, and on it working ONLY without a `permissionDecision` field.
   Both are documented or measured, but the docs carry no version contract and do not
   enumerate the contexts where the field degrades. Make one real ask at the cap and
   confirm the appended question renders.
   **Failure here is QUIET, and quiet in the direction that does not announce itself:**
   the session simply relays the gate's options in its own words again — the
   pre-2026-09 behaviour, and the exact thing the mechanism exists to stop. Nothing
   blocks and nothing errors, because by design no gate reads this back.
9. **Update this document** with findings.

Node floor unchanged (`>=22`). Grep-verified Genesis uses neither Task-tool `mode` nor `/fork` (only GitHub forks + docs), so @212 is inert here. **Follow-through:** (1) @217 nesting — Genesis opts into ONE level (session→subagent→subagent = 3 tiers) via `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_SUBAGENT_SPAWN_DEPTH=2`, shipped IN THIS PR as an `install.sh` user-settings default (set-if-absent, so an operator override is preserved). Value runtime-verified on 2.1.218: the binary's `FZ()` resolver defaults the cap to 1 (= no nesting, matching the @217 changelog), so 2 = exactly one nesting level = 3 tiers; a live nested-dispatch test blocked the 3rd spawn. Reaches installs via `install.sh`/`bootstrap.sh` (like the auto-updater suppression), applied live on this box; `host-setup.sh` deliberately omits it — the host's single-brain recovery `claude -p` never nests. (2) @215 `/code-review` auto-invoke removal — Genesis's own review-enforcement hooks (`review_enforcement_prompt/commit.py`) are now the primary trigger, not a backstop (review-layer unification tracked separately). Post-deploy safety check: confirm workflow/subagent file-writes still hit the PreToolUse approval gate under `claude -p` (@217 auto-approve behavior).

Fixes and hardening dominated; the load-bearing items for Genesis are all late in the range. **Delegation:** from @246 a subagent that hits `maxTurns` returns **partial output without failing**, so a silent early stop is indistinguishable from a genuinely short report — the reason the changelog-read procedure now requires per-release acknowledgement reconciled against the headings rather than trusting a delegate's summary. **Guardian:** @246 fixes a `--strict-mcp-config` startup hang, which lands directly on Guardian Diagnosis. **Worktrees:** @245→@246 fixes a background-retention sweep that reaped user-created `.claude/worktrees/` — relevant because this repo keeps long-lived worktrees per branch. **Headless:** `-p --continue`/`--resume` now resume in plan mode. Node floor unchanged (`engines.node >=22.0.0`, verified against the npm registry at both 2.1.246 and 2.1.251), so `NODE_MAJOR` stays 22 and `cc-node-lockstep` is satisfied without a lockstep bump. | **Pin bumped 2.1.218→2.1.246.** Changelog read over `(2.1.218, 2.1.246]` completed in full from `CHANGELOG.md` before the bump — the mandatory §Updating step-1 gate — and the candidate soaked on the container from 2026-08-25 to 2026-08-31 under the inherited `CC_VERSION` lever, with `check_cc_running_versions.sh` at soak end reporting **every live CC process on the on-disk binary and none stale** — the oldest dating from the align itself, which is what makes the soak continuous rather than merely elapsed — and owner sign-off recorded. (The script additionally reported an `undetermined` process. That is a known false positive, not evidence about any CC session: `cmdline_runs_cc` matches any node process whose first non-flag argument is basename `cli.js`, which catches Playwright's bundled driver as well as Claude Code's launcher, and a node interpreter's inode says nothing about a CC revision. Tracked separately; expect it on any install with the `browser` extra.) The host stayed on 2.1.218 throughout by design — `cc_align_host.sh` aims at the PUBLIC pin, which is what preserved the rollback path during the soak and why merging this row is what actually closes the split. Rolls out to container + host via `scripts/update.sh`; verify the host through a FRESH gateway `version` op, never `host_gateway_state.json`, which is written from the pre-alignment probe. **Target deliberately 2.1.246, not npm `latest` 2.1.251:** 2.1.246 is the version that actually soaked, and a re-target restarts the procedure and resets the soak clock; the 2.1.247–2.1.251 delta rolls into the next cycle. |

## Known Issues

### v2.1.89+ Scrollback Regression — RESOLVED via fullscreen renderer (2026-06-11)

CC v2.1.89 changed default terminal rendering to an alt-screen mode that destroys
terminal scrollback on Linux/tmux. Confirmed cross-platform regression (GitHub issues
#41965, #41814, #42024, #42002, #42076, #42180).

**First mitigation (partial):** CC 2.1.132 added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`,
applied in PR #479 (`settings.json` + `CCInvoker._build_env()`), which unblocked the
version upgrade. This stopped the catastrophic alt-screen corruption but NOT the
classic renderer's residual clipping: repaints inside tmux intermittently drop chunks
of output before tmux commits them to its history (e.g., the first item of a list
missing from scrollback). Still open upstream as of 2.1.173: #52924, #46834, #60464,
#62890. The earlier "fully functional" assessment (2026-06-01) was premature — drops
are intermittent and survived light testing.

**Resolution (2026-06-11):** Interactive sessions switched to the **fullscreen
renderer** (`"tui": "fullscreen"` in user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`). The
conversation lives in CC's virtualized in-app scrollback — nothing is dropped because
tmux history is no longer the source of truth. Scroll with mouse wheel / PgUp; search
via `Ctrl+O` then `/`; export the full transcript into tmux scrollback on demand with
`Ctrl+O` then `[`. Revert with `/tui default`.

Consequently `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1` was **removed** from project
and user `settings.json` — per CC docs it forces the classic renderer regardless of
the `tui` setting, so leaving it set silently defeats fullscreen mode. It remains in
`CCInvoker._build_env()` (`invoker.py`) as defense-in-depth for headless dispatch;
CC docs state renderer settings don't apply to background-session rendering, so it is
harmless there.

**Known cosmetic issue (upstream):** the `/model` banner renders literal `[1m`/`[22m`
(ESC-stripped SGR codes) around the model name — CC bug #66643, present in 2.1.173,
not fixable locally. Do not "fix" with `NO_COLOR`/`TERM=dumb`; that degrades all output.

**History:** Downgraded to v2.1.87 on 2026-04-01; ran on 2.1.138 (auto-updated before
update controls were in place); upgraded to 2.1.159 on 2026-06-01; auto-updater bumped
to 2.1.160 mid-session; 2.1.170 on 2026-06-10; 2.1.173 + fullscreen renderer on
2026-06-11.

### Install Method: npm Only (2026-04-01)

Removed the standalone installer (`curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh`)
in favor of npm-only (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`). The standalone
binary auto-updates on every launch, which silently overrode version pinning.
npm pinning gives full version control. Upgrades are deliberate via recon triage.

**Suppressing the native installer nag:** CC shows a status bar warning when running
from npm. Set `DISABLE_INSTALLATION_CHECKS=1` to suppress this. The install script
adds this to `~/.bashrc` automatically. Do NOT run `claude install`.

**Dual npm prefix gotcha (2026-06-01, revised 2026-06-10):** Containers may have
multiple npm prefix locations. The install script now auto-detects which prefix PATH
resolves by checking `npm config get prefix`:
- **User-level prefix** (e.g. `~/.npm-global`): installs without sudo or `--prefix`,
  so `which claude` finds the new binary directly.
- **System-level prefix** (`/usr/local` or `/usr`): installs with `sudo --prefix /usr/local`
  to avoid the `/usr/lib` misrouting issue.

For manual upgrades, use plain `npm install -g` (no `--prefix`) — it installs to
your configured prefix, which is what PATH finds:
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>
```
If your prefix requires root (`/usr/local`), add `sudo --prefix /usr/local`.

**nvm-managed Node (systemd PATH caveat, 2026-07-18):** `install.sh`/`bootstrap.sh`
resolve `CC_BIN_DIR` = `dirname $(command -v claude)` at **unit-render time** and bake it
into each service's `Environment=PATH`. The templates also carry `~/.npm-global/bin` + the
system dirs as PATH fallbacks, so a wrong `CC_BIN_DIR` is self-covering for every **stable**
prefix (system, `~/.npm-global`, and the `n` version manager — which swaps versions in a
single stable bin dir). The one prefix a fallback cannot cover is a **per-version-directory**
manager: **nvm** installs global binaries under `~/.nvm/versions/node/<version>/bin`, so
`CC_BIN_DIR` bakes a version-scoped path. nvm keeps old version dirs on upgrade, so a plain
`nvm install` is harmless — but if you later remove that Node version (or Genesis's
`cc_shadow_scan` prunes the old nvm copy after CC reinstalls under a new version), the baked
path goes stale and the services can't find `claude` (symptom: `claude: not found` in the
service journal; note `claude` is a self-contained binary and does **not** need `node` on
PATH to launch, so only CC spawning breaks, not the Python runtime). **Fix:** the next
routine `scripts/update.sh` that carries a repo delta re-renders the units automatically
(self-heal). To repair immediately with no pending update, run `./scripts/bootstrap.sh
--force` (the `--force` is required — bootstrap refuses on a live server) then `systemctl
--user restart genesis-server` (and `genesis-bridge` if used) to apply the new PATH — a
`daemon-reload` alone does not re-read `Environment=` for a running unit. Note that a
**no-delta** `update.sh` run (`Already up to date`) early-exits after the CC-pin sync
**without** re-rendering the units (see `scripts/update.sh`'s no-delta early-exit paths — the
"Already up to date" and "Nothing to do" branches; line numbers deliberately omitted, they drift),
so it does not fix a
standalone stale path on its own — use bootstrap directly for that.

**Host VM (verified 2026-06-15):** The host installs Claude Code the **same way as
the container — npm-global**, not the native installer. On this host the npm prefix
is `/usr`, so the package lives in `/usr/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
with the binary at `/usr/bin/claude` (on the default PATH). There is no
`~/.local/share/claude/versions/` tree and no `claude install` subcommand.
> An earlier revision of this section described a native-installer layout under
> `~/.local/` ("do not npm install on the host"); that was **stale** — the live host
> migrated to npm-global. Always trust `type -a claude` + `npm ls -g
> @anthropic-ai/claude-code` over this doc.

Update the host with the Guardian gateway's `update-cc` op (see "Updating Claude
Code" above), which runs — under `sudo` — the same npm install the container uses,
resolving npm next to the in-use `claude` so the global prefix matches. By hand:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@<version>   # e.g. 2.1.173
claude --version                                          # verify
```
`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1`/`DISABLE_UPDATES=1` are set in the host's user-level
`~/.claude/settings.json`, so updates are manual/controlled. Rollback is the same
command with an older version (there is no `requiredMinimumVersion` floor blocking it).

**Host CC reachability:** `/usr/bin/claude` is on the default PATH, so the Guardian
gateway's `version` op resolves it and reports the real version over SSH (confirmed:
`2.1.87`). Guardian diagnosis resolves the binary via `command -v claude`
(`install_guardian.sh` bakes the resolved path into `guardian.yaml`). The host CC
binary used to be managed entirely separately from the Genesis→Guardian *code* sync
(`redeploy`/`update` sync code only) — but `scripts/update.sh` now keeps the host CC
in step with the pin automatically via `update-cc`, so the two no longer drift.

### Auto-Updater Suppression Requires User-Level Settings

**Critical gotcha discovered 2026-06-01:** `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` and
`DISABLE_UPDATES=1` in the **repo's** `.claude/settings.json` are NOT sufficient to
stop CC's auto-updater. The repo settings only apply when CC is launched from the
project directory. The auto-updater runs in contexts where repo settings don't apply.

**Required:** `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` and `DISABLE_UPDATES=1` must be in the
**user-level** `~/.claude/settings.json` on every machine running Genesis (container
+ host VM). This is the file with authority for global CC behavior.

**Automated — and re-asserted on every align, not just at setup.** Both keys are owned
by one shared function, **`cc_ensure_updater_suppressed`** (`scripts/lib/cc_version.sh`):

- `scripts/install.sh` (container) and `scripts/host-setup.sh` (host) call it at setup —
  it creates `~/.claude/settings.json` when absent and merges into an existing one,
  preserving every other key.
- **`cc_ensure_local` calls it FIRST on every align** — i.e. on every `install.sh`,
  `bootstrap.sh`, and `update.sh` run. Deliberately ahead of the pin/npm checks, because
  the common path is "already at pin", which returns early, and that steady state is
  exactly when settings drift would otherwise go unnoticed.
- **A dedicated daily timer makes it RECURRING** — `genesis-cc-settings-align.timer`
  (`scripts/cc_settings_align.sh`). Container-side, its own unit, deliberately NOT folded
  into `genesis-cc-align.timer`: that one is **host-only by contract** and its unit is
  hardened on that basis, so a container-side filesystem write there would invalidate both
  the contract and the sandbox rationale. A dedicated unit also means its status carries
  exactly one meaning — "suppression verified or not" — with no other work to conflate it
  with, so it can fail loudly without muddying an unrelated outcome.
  This matters because the align path only helps a box that RUNS an align: measured on a
  live install, `update.sh` had not run for **14 days**, which is precisely the window in
  which a drifted settings file stays silently unprotected.
- **A non-ok outcome reaches health, not just the log** — the function sets
  `CC_SUPPRESSION_STATE` (`ok` / `repaired` / `failed` / `contended` / `unverified`),
  `update.sh` folds anything other than `ok` into `HOST_CC_DEGRADED` → `update_history` →
  deploy health (the same channel a *version* sync failure uses), and the **service**
  (`genesis-cc-settings-align.service`, driven by the timer of the same name) exits
  non-zero so the unit enters `failed` — visible in
  `systemctl --user status genesis-cc-settings-align.service`. `ok` and `repaired` are EARNED, never defaulted: the state starts `unverified` at
  function entry and is promoted only where a post-operation READ confirms both keys
  (the reconciler's re-read; the python3-less create's grep-back of its own literals;
  the read-only check the align timer runs even when another run holds the write
  lock). A path added later that sets nothing therefore reports `unverified`, which
  every consumer treats as not-ok — fail closed by construction, not by review.
  Every path that did not
  positively verify suppression exits non-zero, including the structural ones (no lock,
  library missing, function renamed away): a run that checked nothing must never report
  success, or the unit becomes a green light for an unguarded updater.
- **The write is a compare-and-swap, not a blind replace.** `settings.json` is rewritten by
  OTHER processes — CC itself persists it on a `/config` change or a permission grant
  (MEASURED: modified mid-session while several CC sessions were live). `os.replace` is
  atomic for *readers* but is not a CAS, so a stale in-memory copy would silently revert a
  concurrent writer. The helper re-checks file identity immediately before the rename and
  retries the whole read-modify instead of clobbering, with a short randomized backoff so
  the three attempts do not all land inside one contended window. Ownership, mode and
  xattrs are carried across (a fresh inode would otherwise widen a credential-bearing
  file), and the write is `fsync`ed before the rename.

  **POSIX ACLs are carried, not refused.** `shutil.copystat` reproduces
  `system.posix_acl_access` on the replacement inode for the file's owner (MEASURED on
  ext4/CPython 3.12; setting that xattr does not require privilege). An earlier revision
  refused to write at all when an ACL was present, assuming a rename could not preserve
  one — a false premise with a severe cost: a *default* ACL on `$HOME` or `~/.claude`
  (routine on NFS and corporate images) gives every file created inside one, so the
  reconciler would never write, suppression would never be established, and the timer would
  fail daily forever with no self-heal. The carry is now VERIFIED after the copy and the
  write abandoned only if it genuinely did not survive.

  The replacement also gets a fresh mtime (`os.utime`) rather than the source's. `copystat`
  carries times too, which would restore the pre-write timestamp and hide the repair from
  every mtime+size change detector — measured: a same-length value correction left size and
  mtime byte-identical. A file this thing rewrote must look rewritten, not least because
  the remediation advice below starts with comparing timestamps.
  **Residual, stated honestly:** the few syscalls between the final check and the rename are
  irreducible without a lock the other writers do not take. A single run therefore cannot
  prove persistence — a **repeat `repaired` across timer ticks** is the real "something on
  this machine keeps rewriting settings.json" signal, and the timer gives that signal a
  receiver: it remembers the previous outcome and **fails the unit on the second
  consecutive repair**. Without that the signal existed only as identical journal lines in
  a unit that stayed green, precisely during the long gaps between deploys when
  `update.sh` (the other consumer of the state) is not running at all.

It is idempotent and silent when correct, and **loud when it repairs drift**
(`! CC auto-updater suppression was MISSING in … — restored: …` on stderr, so it shows
up in update/bootstrap output). It never overwrites a settings file it cannot parse —
a corrupt or foreign file is reported and left alone, since destroying operator settings
is worse than the drift.

**Why the re-assert exists (2026-08-26):** setup-time-only was not enough. This install
was found with `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` present but **`DISABLE_UPDATES` missing** from the
user-level file, and nothing in the recurring paths (`update.sh`, `genesis-cc-align.timer`,
`cc_version.sh`) re-checked it — so a drifted install stayed silently unprotected and the
pin could be violated with no signal. The npm pin only governs what a *deliberate* install
writes; these two keys are what stop CC moving on its own.

This file is per-machine and NOT tracked in the repo. Without this automation CC silently
bumps versions out from under us — discovered when the host VM was running 2.1.119 despite
the 2.1.87 script pin, and again mid-session when the container auto-updated from 2.1.159
to 2.1.160.

**Known coverage gap (the HOST's `settings.json` only):** the container is reconciled on
every align *and* daily via `genesis-cc-settings-align.timer` (above). The host's
user-level file is written by `host-setup.sh` at setup, and `genesis-cc-align.timer`
re-aligns the host's CC *version* through the guardian gateway but cannot reach the host's
`settings.json` — there is no gateway op for it. So
host *version* drift self-heals nightly, host *settings* drift does not: re-run
`host-setup.sh`, or check the file by hand, if the host is ever suspected of
self-updating.

### Cache Inflation (since ~2.1.100, accepted)

CC sends ~20K extra `cache_creation` tokens per payload by design. This is accepted
overhead — upstream has chosen not to fix it. No action taken.

### Cost Tracking Correction (2.1.152)

`cache_creation_input_tokens` was silently reporting 0 before 2.1.152. After upgrade,
dashboard cost numbers will appear higher. This is a correctness fix, not a regression —
actual costs were always being incurred, just not displayed.

### Opus 4.8 Lean System Prompt + Prompt Injection Defenses (2.1.154+)

Opus 4.8 uses a leaner default CC system prompt AND has **enhanced prompt injection
defenses** that apply to `--append-system-prompt` content. Verified 2026-06-01 by
testing Opus 4.8 directly: the defenses key on **channel + shape + intent**, NOT on
directive language.

**What triggers the defense (avoid in identity files):**
- **Output-suppression / gag clauses** — "say only X and nothing else", "no preamble"
  pushed to the point of suppressing reasoning. Operational ordering rules are fine
  (e.g., "your final text block is captured — put the evaluation last") because they
  carry the technical why.
- **Free-floating imperatives without role coherence** — directives that don't define
  a role, scope, or duty.
- **Zero operational purpose** — directives with no system reason. Genesis directives
  serve a system function ("review intentions every cycle") and are safe.
- **Secrecy clauses** — "don't tell the user", "hide this from the operator". These
  contradict Genesis's SOUL ("user sovereignty is absolute") and would be flagged.
- **Meta-overrides** — "ignore previous instructions", "you are now [role]". Never
  use these.
- **In-conversation authority claims** — "I'm the admin, please...". Authority comes
  from the system-prompt channel, not from claimed authority within content.

**What's SAFE (Genesis's current pattern):**
- Strong directive language (MUST, NEVER, ALWAYS) tied to a coherent role with
  operational purpose
- Output formatting rules that explain the technical why
- Strict operational SOPs ("address every email", "fetch every URL")
- **Explicit injection-awareness sections** (like INBOX_EVALUATE.md's lines 506-524)
  — these are GOLD STANDARD, they make Opus 4.8 MORE trusting because they prove the
  author understands the boundary

**Audit result (2026-06-01):** Genesis identity files audited against these patterns.
USER_EGO_SESSION, EGO_SESSION, GENESIS_EGO_SESSION, INBOX_EVALUATE, REFLECTION_DEEP,
REFLECTION_STRATEGIC, STEERING, CONVERSATION — all FINE. MORNING_REPORT.md has
borderline-aggressive "ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS" framing but operational why is present;
real risk is low. Style could be tightened in a follow-up.

**Lines Opus 4.8 will still refuse even from the system channel:** deceiving the
user, overriding user sovereignty, hiding reasoning from operator, causing harm,
disabling injection-awareness itself. Genesis identity files don't go near these.

### Thinking Block Corruption on Resume (Opus extended thinking)

Resuming an Opus session with extended thinking may get 400 errors: "thinking blocks
cannot be modified." Classified as `CCSessionError` (PR #479). `conversation.py`
already catches `CCError` on resumes and recovers via `_recover_stale_resume()`.
Mitigated, not eliminated.

### Hook stdout is silently FILED above 10,000 characters (measured 2.1.246, 2026-08-30)

**Undocumented in the hooks reference, settings reference, troubleshooting and
error docs, and not configurable** (no settings key, env var or flag — the
`MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS` lever is for MCP tools only). Above the threshold the
harness writes the hook's whole stdout to
`~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>/tool-results/hook-<uuid>-stdout.txt` and
hands the model a `<persisted-output>` wrapper with a **2,000-character
preview**. Nothing errors. The session simply runs without whatever sat below
the preview.

**Measured on this install's pinned binary, via ~25 real probe sessions**
(`GENESIS_CTX_PROBE_BYTES=<n>` makes `scripts/genesis_session_context.py` emit
exactly n filler characters; classify from the new session's transcript —
inline vs `Output too large`):

| Fact | Value | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Threshold | **exactly 10,000 chars** | 10,000 inline / 10,001 filed |
| Unit | **characters**, not bytes | 6,000 two-byte chars (12,044 B) inline |
| Scope | **per hook entry** | two SessionStart hooks × 9,000 chars → both inline |
| Mode | same in `-p` and interactive | both file at 10,001 |
| Version volatility | **yes** | on 2.1.218 the threshold sat near the high 20 Ks (filings were rare, 28–32 KB); the 2.1.246 update dropped it to 10 K and the filing rate on this box tripled the same day (2–6/day → 16–21/day) |
| Remote tunability | **UNVERIFIED — do not assume either way** | CC does use remote feature gates generally (the `we("tengu_<name>", <default>)` idiom appears throughout the bundle), and the TOOL-result threshold resolver consults a per-name override map. But the hook path does not visibly go through that resolver, and the minified symbol is reused across bundles, so nothing ties a remote gate to THIS threshold. Treat a cap change as possible without a version bump, and rely on the filings watcher rather than on the pin, but do not state remote tunability as fact |

**Ordering between hook entries is COMPLETION order, not declaration order**
(MEASURED 2026-08-30, 6 real sessions). The part doing a subprocess + a DB read
lands last in 6/6 runs even though it is declared first, and the two disk-only
parts swap between runs. So do not reason about where one hook's block sits
relative to another's — and note this cannot be measured by "read the newest
transcript": with concurrent sessions on the box that picks someone else's, which
briefly produced a phantom "the charter part vanished" result here. Attribute a
probe to its own transcript by before/after set difference.

**Which hook events can put stdout in front of the model at all** (READ from
the bundle's attachment renderer, 2.1.246, and corroborated by the published
hooks reference): only **SessionStart**, **UserPromptSubmit**,
**UserPromptExpansion** — the docs additionally name `PostModelSwitch`. Every
other event (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, **Stop**, SubagentStop, PreCompact,
SessionEnd) reaches the model ONLY through JSON `additionalContext` /
`systemMessage`, and each of those strings is run through the SAME 10,000-char
persistence path. Two consequences worth stating plainly: a Stop hook that
`print`s advice on exit 0 is **inert** (its stdout goes to the debug log), and
an oversized JSON advisory can lose its *decision*, not merely its prose —
which is why `scripts/hooks/hook_output.py` trims named free-text fields and
never the envelope.

**Reading a filed payload back is safe and idempotent.** The Read tool's
`maxResultSizeChars` is `Infinity` (it short-circuits the threshold resolver
and is exempt from the ~200,000-char per-message aggregate budget), so a 30 KB
filed part comes back whole, once, and cannot be re-persisted. Its real limits
are 2,000 lines / 25,000 tokens, and exceeding those is an *error*, not a
silent wrapper. That is what makes "Read the path the wrapper names" a viable
recovery instruction rather than a loop.

**Identity via CLAUDE.md `@import` was evaluated as an alternative and
REJECTED** (measured 2026-08-30, real `claude -p` probes). Imports do work:
they survive `-p` and `--system-prompt`, and a 14,430-char imported file
arrives whole. Two disqualifiers: (1) a **missing import is a SILENT skip** —
no warning, no note — and `src/genesis/identity/USER.md` is gitignored and
absent on a fresh clone, so every clone would silently lose the user profile,
which is precisely this class of bug; (2) the only suppression lever,
`--setting-sources user`, drops project **hooks** along with project CLAUDE.md
(controlled: with the flag both a project hook sentinel and a CLAUDE.md
sentinel disappear; without it both appear), so executor/eval lanes — which run
with a worktree cwd — would lose their guards. `--bare` also skips CLAUDE.md
auto-discovery but forces `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`-only auth, which this install
does not use. CLAUDE.md itself has a 4 MiB ceiling and is dropped whole above
it (no truncation); the docs recommend under 200 lines for adherence.

Consequence: the SessionStart injection ships as **four hook entries**
(`--part charter | identity-core | identity-user | knowledge`), each held under
`_PART_BUDGET = 9_800` — enforced at a single chokepoint (`BoundedStdout` in
`scripts/hooks/hook_output.py`) so a block that forgets to check its budget
cannot overrun. The DEGRADE decisions live there too: a caller says what the
fallback looks like (`emit_or_degrade(pointer=…, notice=…)`) and never computes
characters, because every number it used to compute by hand — the divider,
`print`'s newline, the closing-line reserve, the room remaining — was found
wrong by review at least once. The full intended text is mirrored to
`~/.genesis/sessions/<sid>/context-<part>.md` so an in-band cut stays
recoverable. Each part opens with a `[genesis-ctx:<part> · mirror: …]` recovery
header, which sits inside the harness's 2 KB preview by construction — the one
place a filed part is still visible. Backed by an awareness watcher over the
harness's own filings (`context_injection_monitor`, critical → Telegram) that
never reads our constant.
**After any CC bump, re-run the probe** at 9,978 / 9,979 (the exact edge
including the 22-char probe wrapper) and at two-hook 9 K + 9 K; if either
moves, the constants to revisit are `HOOK_STDOUT_CAP` in
`scripts/hooks/hook_output.py` — its ONE home, which every emitter reads — and
the part budgets. Do NOT edit `genesis_session_context._HOOK_STDOUT_CAP`: it is
a re-export assigned from that constant, so changing it moves nothing while
looking like it did.

Measurement traps met while establishing this, so the next person does not
repeat them: (1) the `Output too large (NNkB)` parenthetical is the OUTPUT's
size, not the cap; (2) a Bash TOOL result probe does not transfer to hooks
(tools carry per-tool `maxResultSizeChars`); (3) an interactive probe with no
typed turn writes no transcript, and "newest transcript" mis-attributes a
concurrent session's — identify your own transcript by before/after set
difference and send a real turn.

### A PreToolUse hook can REWRITE an `AskUserQuestion` — variant B only (measured 2.1.246, 2026-09-13; docs confirmed 2026-09-14)

A PreToolUse hook returning `updatedInput` under `hookSpecificOutput` rewrites the
tool input before the tool runs. It is **documented** (hooks reference), it is
**documented as applying to `AskUserQuestion`**, and it is what lets a gate put its own
question in front of the user instead of the session's retelling
(`scripts/hooks/ask_gate_menu.py`).

| shape | payload | result |
|---|---|---|
| A — with a decision | `{"hookSpecificOutput": {…, "permissionDecision": "allow", "updatedInput": {…}}}` | the call returns **"user did not answer"** WITHOUT the user acting |
| **B — the only one that works** | `{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "updatedInput": {…}}}` | the rewritten questions render; the user answers normally |

Variant A's failure is a FALSE NEGATIVE that reads exactly like a real decline, which is
what makes it dangerous. The docs independently state that a `permissionDecision: "deny"`
alongside `updatedInput` discards the rewrite; the `"allow"` case above is undocumented
and measured here. Two reasons, one rule: never emit that field alongside `updatedInput`.
A test pins its absence.

**The apparent docs contradiction is NOT one.** "There is no built-in `AskUserQuestion`
hook type" is about hook EVENT types (there is no `AskUserQuestion` event); "all tools
fire PreToolUse" is about which TOOLS fire it. Both true, and the tool does fire it.

**Schema bounds, read from the binary — the OPTIONS axis has a hard MINIMUM**, which the
questions axis does not: `options:Me(J7o()).min(2).max(4)` against
`questions:Me(mnr()).min(1).max(4)`. Out of range is not a shorter menu — CC rejects the
WHOLE call, the person never sees it, and the steer says *"Do not retry this call."* So a
hook that rewrites this tool must bound the option count itself, since the rewrite
bypasses whatever the model would have produced — and must TEST that bound by driving
the builder with an out-of-range set, not by asserting statically about the shipped
constant. MEASURED: a static assertion left the guard unexercised, and deleting it
entirely kept the suite green.

The 4-question maximum has a consequence worth stating for any hook that APPENDS: a
call already carrying four questions cannot be appended to, so the append must be
skipped rather than risk the rejection. That makes an appending hook suppressible by
a caller that pads to four. `header` is described as max 12
characters but is a bare `z.string()`, so an over-long value renders clipped rather than
rejecting. There is also a whole-call refinement an appending hook can violate without
touching any single field: **question TEXTS must be unique across the call**, and option
labels unique within a question. Replacing a forged copy of your question in place (rather
than appending a second one) satisfies the first by construction; appending blind does not.
These bounds are **undocumented** — the binary is the only source.

**An invalid rewrite is a DENY, not a no-op — so a rewriting hook's own bounds checks are
load-bearing, not defensive padding.** MEASURED in the binary: `updatedInput` is accepted
only on the branch where no `permissionBehavior` is set, and if it fails the tool's input
schema CC converts it to `behavior: "deny"` **attributed to the hook by name**. So the
cheerful framing "a broken rewrite just costs the feature" is wrong: it costs the user's
question. Anyone relaxing an option-count or uniqueness guard on the grounds that the
failure is harmless is mis-pricing it by a severity level.

Also measured: exactly **one** PreToolUse invocation per call, so an unconditional append
cannot compound. And `procedure_advisor.py` (matcher `.*`) emits **nothing** for
`AskUserQuestion`, so its `permissionDecision: "allow"` never meets another hook's
`updatedInput` — verified by feeding it the payload directly, not inferred from the
matcher.

**The transcript is NOT a record of what the user saw.** It stores the tool call AS THE
AGENT EMITTED IT — substitution is applied afterwards — so a transcript-read
"verification" of what was presented reads exactly the untrusted values it is trying to
check. PR #1863 built that; do not rebuild it.

**Undocumented edges, stated so the gap is not mistaken for a guarantee.** The docs do
not enumerate contexts where `updatedInput` degrades (remote/cloud, headless, subagents),
and a path exists in the bundle that records the field as dropped on the PreToolUse
branch — scope UNVERIFIED. Failure THERE is menu-absent (the field is dropped, so the
call proceeds unrewritten), which is distinct from the schema-invalid case above. Re-probe
on every pin bump; there is no version contract for the field.

### Bypass/auto mode tells the agent to edit via Bash — safe for reads, NOT for writes (measured 2.1.246, 2026-09-05)

In bypass or auto permission mode the CC binary injects a meta message:
> Do your work through the Bash tool wherever it can accomplish the job: read
> files with cat, head, or sed -n, search with grep and find, and **make file
> changes with sed, heredocs, or short scripts**, rather than using the
> dedicated Read, Edit, or Write tools. Fall back to a dedicated tool only when
> Bash genuinely cannot do the job.

**Provenance (established, not inferred):** the text is compiled into the CC
binary; it is in no `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, output-style, or agent file.

**It reaches a session by three routes, not one.** The selector falls through
the bypass flag, then the steer-only flag, then — and this is the one that
matters — a `bashFirst` flag, which is a COHORT assignment
(`bashFirstSessionAssignment`, resolving to forced/cohort/none) rather than a
permission mode. **A default-mode session can therefore receive this message.**
An earlier draft of this section said it was emitted purely on permission mode;
that was read off a truncated transcription and is wrong.

It is still an **efficiency heuristic** making no correctness claim — but that
follows from what the message SAYS, not from where it is gated: it is phrased as
a preference and carries its own escape hatch back to the dedicated tools. The
same is true of the sibling `AgentTool`/workflows restriction lines: also in the
binary (`grep -c -a -F` → 2 occurrences each), also not install config. Neither
is install-specific; both apply to every CC user of this version.

**Reads: follow it.** `cat`/`sed -n`/`grep`/`find` are cheaper round-trips and
carry no correctness cost.

**Writes to source: do NOT use bare `sed -i`. Prefer Edit/Write.** Measured
contrast (fixtures + results kept locally under `~/tmp/edit-probe/`, pre-registered
decision rule):

| case | `sed -i` | Edit |
|---|---|---|
| anchor absent | exit 0, file unchanged, **no error** (silent no-op) | refuses: "String to replace not found" |
| anchor non-unique (×3) | exit 0, **replaces all 3**, incl. unrelated lines | refuses, names the count, demands `replace_all` |
| anchor with regex metachar, literal intent | exit 0, **wrong-target rewrite or silent no-op** | applied correctly (literal match) |
| control: valid unique anchor | applied | applied |

Three reasons the split is correct HERE specifically (all universal to any
Genesis clone, since the machinery is tracked):
1. **`sed`'s silent-failure contract** above is `sed`, not this box — a
   mis-anchored edit that changes nothing, or the wrong thing, returns exit 0.
2. **`Edit`/`Write` fire five EDIT-SPECIFIC PostToolUse hooks** wired in the tracked
   `.claude/settings.json` (`edit_verify_advisory`, `file_modification_audit`,
   `edit_failure_sensor`, `subsystem_traps`, `file_context`); a `Bash` write
   fires none of them, so the repo's own post-edit verification plane never
   sees the change.
3. **Heredoc writes sit in blocked-compound blast radius** — a PreToolUse block
   discards the whole call including the heredoc, silently.
MEASURED cost of ignoring this in practice, **and state the dialect or the
number means nothing**: `sed` uses BRE by default, where `+ ? | ( ) { }` are
literal. Counting only the characters BRE actually treats as special
(`. * [ ] ^ $ \`), **54.9% of realistic edit anchors in this repo carry one**
(2,750 / 5,013 removed lines ≥8 chars over the last 200 non-merge commits on
`src/` + `scripts/`; re-derivable, 2026-09-06). The same corpus scores 74.0%
against an ERE set, which is what an earlier revision of this line reported as
"75.2%" — a real number for the wrong dialect. Either way the unsafe case is the
common
one, not a tail. A "short script" that does a literal `str.replace` AND asserts
its occurrence count is acceptable — it re-implements Edit's two checks by hand.

## Known Risks

### Rebase-Like Risk for CC
CC updates are NOT like AZ rebases — we don't fork CC, we consume it as a tool.
But our wrappers (CCInvoker especially) depend on CLI behavior. If CC changes its
output format or flag semantics, our wrappers break silently.

**Mitigation:** Integration tests that exercise CCInvoker with real CC CLI calls.
Currently: `scripts/test_cc_cli.sh` (manual). Phase 7+: automated in CI.

### An MCP server that misses the connect timeout is dropped SILENTLY for the life of the process (measured 2.1.246, 2026-09-13)

CC gives each MCP server **30 000 ms** to connect, and a server that misses it is
dropped for that CC PROCESS — not retried, and **not restored by `/clear`**, which
starts a new session inside the same process. The session then runs with that
server's tools simply absent from its registry. Nothing announces it: no banner,
no context line, no tool-list note.

MEASURED on this install, from CC's own log
(`~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/<project>/mcp-logs-<server>/<start>.jsonl`):

```
23:36:16.161Z  Starting connection with timeout of 30000ms
23:36:46.163Z  Connection timeout triggered after 30003ms (limit: 30000ms)
23:36:46.170Z  Connection failed (CONNECT_TIMEOUT)
```

The session ran without all 34 `genesis-memory` tools and was discovered only by
reaching for one. `claude mcp list` said `Connected` throughout — that command
opens its OWN probe connections and says nothing about what a given running
session holds.

**Why it happens here.** A session starts **8 servers inside an 11-second
window**, four of which are heavy Python trees. `-X importtime` on the memory
server: 5.50 s of imports before any of its own code runs (`litellm` 4.37 s,
`fastmcp` 2.50 s, `qdrant_client.http` 1.95 s — subtrees overlap, so they do not
sum), then runtime init, for ~10.5 s standalone. Against 6 cores at load ~7.5,
that overruns 30 s.

**Rate, with the denominator each figure belongs to.** Across EVERY server in one
install's log dir: **2 incidents / 1,646 connect attempts (0.12 %)**. Per server,
the two that have ever timed out are `genesis-memory` (**1 / 217, 0.46 %**) and
`gitnexus` (**1 / 215, 0.47 %**) — note it is not a single-server problem, which
is the reason to fix the ceiling rather than one server. Count INCIDENTS, not
matching lines: each timeout writes `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` twice (`Connection failed
after Nms (CONNECT_TIMEOUT)` and `Connection failed (CONNECT_TIMEOUT)`), so a
line-count double-counts.

Frequency was never the real argument, though: the worst SUCCESSFUL connect was
**25 395 ms**, i.e. 85 % of the 30 s ceiling. The margin was the problem.

**Mitigation (shipped), in TWO halves — one is not enough:**

1. `MCP_TIMEOUT: "120000"` in the repo's `.claude/settings.json` `env` block, for
   sessions that read repo settings.
2. The same value in `CCInvoker._build_env`, because **most dispatched sessions
   never read those settings** — they run with a cwd outside any git repo, so CC
   does not load them. Without half 2 the entire background fleet (reflection,
   research, sentinel, direct sessions) keeps the 30 s default, which is the worst
   place to miss: an unattended session has nobody to notice its tools are gone.
   (A worktree-cwd dispatch is the exception and DOES load repo settings; both
   halves carry the same number, so those paths agree either way. A test compares
   the two, since they cannot share a constant.)

VERIFIED end-to-end — a CC process started after the change logs
`Starting connection with timeout of 120000ms` where it previously logged
`30000ms`.

**`MCP_TIMEOUT` is NOT connect-only, despite where it shows up in the log.**
MEASURED in the 2.1.246 binary, one getter reads it and is applied to the server
connect, generic MCP requests, `tools/list`, resource reads, the `mcp_tool` hook
cap and the subscriptions listen stream. So raising it also widens the ceiling on
a server that wedges MID-session, not just at startup — 120 s per operation
instead of 30 s, against a shortest MCP-carrying dispatch budget of 600 s.

CC has a **separate** `MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 5000 ms) sitting beside it
in the same env registry, and a third `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT`. Do not conflate them —
naming a local constant after the connect variable sends the next maintainer to
the wrong one, which is a mistake this repo made and corrected.

**This makes the drop rarer, not visible.** Detecting and announcing a missing
server is separate work (see the issue tracking it). Until that lands, the way to
check a suspicion is to read the per-server log named above for the CURRENT
process and look for `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` — not to run `claude mcp list`.

### Desktop vs Server Gap
CC's feature roadmap prioritizes desktop app experiences (scheduled tasks, teleport,
cowork). Server-side/CLI features are secondary. Genesis runs on a headless server.
Monitor whether key features become desktop-exclusive. The v2.1.89 scrollback
regression is an example — rendering optimizations designed for desktop apps
degrading the headless/tmux experience.
