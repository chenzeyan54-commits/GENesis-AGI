"""WS-3 B1 gates 2-3 (identity / autonomy) coverage locks.

Same forcing-function idea as ``test_recall_inject_coverage.py`` (gate 4) and
``test_procedure_gate_coverage.py`` (gate 1): discovery is AST-based, every
discovered site needs an explicit disposition, and every 'gated' site must
actually emit — so a new writer/caller can't ship provenance-unclassified and
a removed emit fails CI.

GATE-2 (identity): the choke methods are identity/loader.py's ``write_text``
enclosers, pinned by SET-EQUALITY (a new/moved raw write in loader.py fails).
Callers of the public writers are discovered and must be registered. The
dashboard config-file PUT writer (outside loader.py, generic ``write_text``)
is pinned MANUALLY — an AST sweep scoped to loader can't see it.

GATE-3 (autonomy): discovery is IMPORT-ALIAS-RESOLVED — only ``Attribute``
calls on names bound to ``genesis.db.crud.capability_grants`` count, which
excludes the many unrelated ``record_success`` collisions (telegram typing
breakers, routing circuit breaker, AutonomyManager's legacy autonomy_state
path). The emits live INSIDE the crud choke (``_emit_autonomy_gate``); callers
THREAD origin_class (a REQUIRED kwarg — locked below — so a future caller must
state provenance or fail loudly at call time).

OUT OF GATE-3 SCOPE: the legacy ``autonomy_state`` evidence store
(db/crud/autonomy.py record_success/record_correction via AutonomyManager —
audit.py, surplus/dispatch.py, learning/pipeline.py). Same threat shape on a
parallel LIVE store, but all writers are Genesis's own execution telemetry
(first_party) and the store is slated to stay authoritative for non-email
readers (capability_grants.py module docstring). Documented exclusion, not
silent — revisit if any external-influenced writer appears.
