"""Controls for the atomic-write guard, in BOTH directions.

WHY THIS FILE IS MOSTLY CONTROLS. The guard went through two versions that both
LOOKED correct and were wrong in opposite directions -- one called 5 of 6 known
leaks safe, the next admitted 16 `dataclasses.replace` calls as filesystem
writes. Neither was caught by running it. A detector that finds nothing is
indistinguishable from one that looks at nothing, so the shapes it must flag and
the shapes it must ignore are both pinned here, and the real known-clean and
known-leaking sites in this repo anchor it to reality.

Install-agnostic: synthetic sources for the detector, and repo-relative reads for
the anchors. No network, no live DB, no ~/.genesis, no wall clock.
