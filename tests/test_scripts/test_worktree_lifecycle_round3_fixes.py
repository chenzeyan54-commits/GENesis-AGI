"""Regressions for the third review round on the archiving reaper.

Six findings, grouped by what actually breaks rather than by file position:

  * **Confidentiality** — a reaped worktree is a verbatim copy of someone's
    working tree and routinely holds a 0600 `.env` or key. Archiving it under a
    normal umask republished it at 0644 inside a 0755 directory.
  * **Durability** — the archive was verified through the page cache and the
    source deleted without ever forcing either the data or the rename to disk.
  * **Reachability** — two ways the anchor that keeps archived commits alive
    could be absent (a ref-illegal tag name) or unusable (a deleted branch on
    recovery), plus a nested worktree the parent's anchor does not cover.
  * **Honesty of the board** — a failed enumeration was indistinguishable from
    an empty one, so a broken scan published "no worktrees exist".

Each case pairs the defect with a control that moves the other way, because
every one of these is a property where asserting only the good case would pass
against code that does nothing.

    entries per worktree — ``<name>.tar.gz`` and the ``<name>.meta.json``
    sidecar — so that glob matches both and ``next()`` takes whichever the
    filesystem happens to yield first. Directory order is not defined and
    differs between filesystems, so the same test picks the archive on one box
    and the sidecar on another; opening the sidecar as a gzip stream fails with
    ``tarfile.ReadError: not a gzip file``.

    MEASURED: that is precisely how this suite failed in CI while passing
    locally — 150 local passes, one CI failure, on a run whose log truncated
    before the failure and named nothing. The production code already selects
    by suffix (``worktree_lifecycle.ARCHIVE_SUFFIX``); the tests did not.
