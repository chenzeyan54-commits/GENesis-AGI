"""Tests for scripts/worktree_lifecycle.py — the daily worktree reaper.

Regression coverage for the detached-HEAD blind spot: ``git worktree list
--porcelain`` emits a bare ``detached`` line (no ``branch``) for a detached
worktree, so the reaper used to default ``branch="unknown"`` and skip such
worktrees forever even when their HEAD commit is fully merged into ``main``.

These use REAL git repos in ``tmp_path`` (the house pattern from
``test_git_repair.py``); the reaper shells out to git directly, so there is no
mock seam. The load-bearing invariants under test:
  * ``_list_worktrees`` marks a detached worktree (``detached=True``, no ``branch``);
  * a detached HEAD at a MERGED commit is classified reapable, at an UNMERGED
    commit is kept (fail-safe);
  * the branch path is unchanged (merged branch still reaped);
  * ``main()`` reaps ONLY the merged worktrees and trashes recoverably;
  * a trashed detached worktree round-trips through ``_recover`` (re-added detached
    at its commit), not just a plain-directory move.

    Archiving locks the worktree's registration, and the lock is the only thing
    keeping the archived commits reachable -- `git worktree prune` and `git gc`

    Recovery has to release it so `git worktree add --force` can take the path
    over. When everything after that fails, an earlier version returned with the
    registration still unlocked, so the tarball sat in the trash pointing at
    commits the next gc could collect.

    The same path also ran a repo-wide `git worktree prune`, which is harmless to
    every OTHER archive -- theirs are locked -- and fatal to this one, whose lock
    had just been released.

    REACHING THE PATH IS THE HARD PART, and the first version of this test did
    not: occupying the destination trips an "already exists" check that returns
    BEFORE the unlock, so the lock was still held for trivial reasons and the
    test passed against a `_relock` that did nothing. Both the checkout and the
    fallback move have to fail, with the destination free, to land on a return
