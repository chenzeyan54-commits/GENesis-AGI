"""Every model-facing hook is bounded, or is exempt for a stated reason.

THE CLASS THIS LOCKS. Claude Code FILES a hook's stdout above a per-hook-entry
size cap (10,000 characters on 2.1.246 — version-volatile) and shows the model a
~2 KB preview. Nothing errors and the exit code is unchanged, so a hook that
silently contributed nothing is indistinguishable from one that worked.

MEASURED, by enumerating every filing the harness has made on this install
(849/849 by content, not a sample): 842 were one emitter, fixed by #1556 when it
moved that output behind ``scripts/hooks/hook_output.py``; 7 were a guard removed
in #1106; and ZERO came from the eleven hooks (nine Python, two shell) wired
today. So this test is not chasing a live incident — #1556 already closed the one
that existed. It exists because nothing stops the NEXT hook being wired with
unbounded model-facing output, and CLAUDE.md's instruction to "route any new
model-facing stdout through it" is prose with no mechanism behind it.

WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE, stated so nobody reads it as total coverage. It
enumerates ``.claude/settings.json`` only — the repo's wiring. A user-level
``~/.claude/settings.json`` (which on this install wires further SessionStart
entries) and ``.claude/settings.local.json`` are real CC layers outside the
repo's control, and a hook wired there is invisible here. The detector also
matches ``print`` and ``sys.stdout.write``/``writelines``; it does NOT catch
``os.write(1, …)``, a print aliased to another name, or a subprocess that
inherits stdout — nor output produced by a helper module the hook imports, since
only the hook's own source is parsed.

AN EXEMPTION STILL SKIPS THE PRINT SCAN — measured by adding an unbounded
``sys.stdout.write`` to an exempted hook and watching that scan stay green. What
changed is that every row now carries a CHECKER re-running a NECESSARY CONDITION
of its claim against the current file (see the block at the bottom), so a row
cannot drift silently from the code while nobody re-reads it.

A necessary condition, NOT a verification, and the difference is the whole
honesty of this block. A checker establishes that a constant or a pattern still
EXISTS; none of them proves it still BINDS the output. Cross-model review made
that concrete on all four: a structural clamp can be named and dead while the
raw config value flows past it; declared ceilings can multiply under the cap
while nothing applies them to a line; a shell file can contain no ``$`` and
still pipe bulk output to stdout. Proving the binding needs dataflow analysis,
pathological inputs driven through the real entry point, or a synthetic process
ancestry — weighed and declined as a test suite per row for five small files.

So the table still stays SMALL on purpose — every row is a place the print scan
stops looking — and ROUTING a hook through the writer is strictly preferred over
adding a row, because routing enforces the bound at the write instead of
asserting anything about it. ``scripts/contribution_offer_hook.py`` was a row
here and is not any more, for exactly that reason.

SCOPE. Only ``SessionStart``, ``UserPromptSubmit`` and ``UserPromptExpansion``
put a hook's BARE STDOUT in front of the model. ``_BARE_STDOUT_EVENTS`` is
DERIVED from ``scripts/hooks/hook_output.py``'s own ``BARE_STDOUT_EVENTS`` by
AST, so this file keeps no copy to drift. Note the published hooks reference also
names ``PostModelSwitch``, which is deliberately NOT gated -- the reason is
recorded beside that constant. Every other event reaches it through JSON
``additionalContext``/``systemMessage``, which runs through the same persistence
path but has a different failure mode — an oversized advisory must lose prose,
never its ``permissionDecision``, which is what ``print_json_bounded`` protects.
Those events are deliberately out of scope here rather than exempted in bulk: a
36-entry exemption list on day one would be a rubber stamp.

POLARITY IS ALLOWLIST, ON PURPOSE. A wired hook that is neither routed nor
explicitly listed FAILS. Its sibling ``test_hook_input_contract.py`` is a
denylist — it catches one known-bad spelling — and a denylist cannot notice a
hook nobody thought about. That difference is the whole point of this file.

Install-agnostic: synthetic payloads, no network, no live DB.

    """Module-level ``NAME = <int>`` assignments in ``path``, read by AST.

    Shared because the comprehension was written out twice and the two copies
    are exactly the kind that drift apart — one gains a case the other does not.
    ``ast.AnnAssign`` is handled as well as ``ast.Assign``: tests/test_hooks/
    test_shell_parse.py records a version of this that handled only the first
    and silently missed an annotated constant, which reads as "the constant is
    gone" rather than as a gap in the reader.

    MODULE SCOPE IS THE CONTRACT, so this iterates the parsed module's own body
    rather than ``ast.walk``. Walking descends into function and class bodies,
    where an ordinary local of the same name shadows the real constant — and the
    direction that matters is the silent one: delete the module constant, leave a
    nested literal behind, and a caller asserting a ceiling still reads a number
    and still passes, with the ceiling it names gone. Measured on the two files
    read here: walking additionally collected ``matches``, ``named`` and
    ``total``, all function locals, and none of them a constant of any kind.

    IT IS A TRADE, NOT A PURE WIN, and saying otherwise here would be this file's
    own recurring defect wearing the opposite polarity. Narrowing gives up the one
    case the wide scan caught: a ``global`` rebind inside a function, where the
    module literal stays honest and the runtime ceiling is something else.
    MEASURED — module ``_MAX_NUDGE_LINE = 400`` left in place, a ``global`` rebind
    to 50_000 added inside a function: ``ast.walk`` went RED, this reader stays
    GREEN, with the hook's real ceiling 125x over the cap. Taken deliberately on
    three grounds. The wide scan caught it BY ACCIDENT and only in one direction —
    a rebind to a SMALLER number passes either way. A leftover local after a
    deleted constant is the common refactor; a ``global`` rebind of a ceiling is
    not. And the caller most exposed to it already declares itself a necessary,
    not sufficient, condition. Proving the ceiling actually binds needs dataflow,
    which is the row's standing open alternative rather than this reader's job.

    By AST, never by import: these constants are version-volatile by design, and
    importing the hook would execute it.

# WHAT A CHECKER IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. Every one below tests a NECESSARY
# condition for its row's claim, never a sufficient one, and each is named for
# the condition it actually tests rather than for the row it serves. That
# distinction is not pedantry — the first revision named them for the rows
# (`_check_cbm_session_reminder`), which reads as "this row is verified", and
# cross-model review returned four findings saying exactly that: the checks
# establish that a constant or a pattern EXISTS, not that it BINDS the output.
# All four were correct. A structural clamp can be named and dead; constants can
# multiply under the cap and no longer constrain any line; a file can contain no
# `$` and still pipe a large command into stdout.
#
# Proving the binding needs real machinery — assignment-to-call dataflow,
# pathological inputs driven through the hook, a synthetic process ancestry.
# That was weighed and declined: it is a test suite per row for five small
# files. So these stay cheap, and the NAMES and docstrings carry the honest
# scope instead. Each one below says what it cannot catch.
#
# Two dicts rather than one `path -> (reason, checker)` mapping, deliberately:
# the reason table sits at the top of this file where it is read, and the
# checkers need helpers defined further down. Keeping them separate and
# asserting the key sets are EQUAL gives the same guarantee — an unpaired entry
# on either side fails — without hoisting 120 lines of checker above the table.

    ancestor EXISTS, so the marker branch runs and an `echo` added there is
    caught. On a CI runner it does not, the branch never executes, and the same
    `echo` sails through while the checker reports empty stdout — passing for a
