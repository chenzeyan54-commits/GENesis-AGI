"""Behavioural lock for the dated-docs privacy rule in `.gitignore`.

The rule (`docs/**/20[0-9][0-9]-*`) is the only thing standing between a
working artifact dropped into an opt-in docs directory and a `git add -A` that
publishes it to a PUBLIC repo. It lives inside a ~35-line block of interacting
ignore/negate rules: `docs/*` ignores everything, per-directory `!docs/<dir>/`
negations open specific directories back up, and this rule re-closes the dated
files inside them.

Nothing asserted that, so a later edit could reopen the leak with no signal.

THE ACTUAL HAZARD, measured rather than assumed. An earlier version of this
docstring named "reordering the block" as the risk. That is FALSE, and the
correction matters because it points at the wrong edit. Probed in a scratch
repo against `docs/architecture/2026-x.md`:

    baseline (rule last)                       -> IGNORED
    `!docs/architecture/**` added BELOW rule    -> NOT ignored   <-- LEAK
    `!docs/architecture/*`  added BELOW rule    -> NOT ignored   <-- LEAK
    `!/docs/public-new/**`  added BELOW rule    -> NOT ignored   <-- LEAK
    `!docs/actions/sub/**`  added BELOW rule    -> NOT ignored   <-- LEAK
    block REORDERED (rule above the opt-ins)   -> IGNORED

A directory-form negation (`!docs/<dir>/`) matches only the directory
component and never the file path beneath it, so it cannot win last-match-wins
against a file pattern regardless of order — reordering the current block is
safe. What DOES reopen the leak is specifically a `/*` or `/**` negation placed
below the rule, in ANY of its spellings: root-anchored (`!/docs/...`, which
`gitignore(5)` defines as anchoring to the `.gitignore` directory) and NESTED
(`!docs/<dir>/<sub>/**`) leak exactly as readily as the top-level form. The
negation scan below therefore routes on shape, not on segment count, and fails
loudly on any docs negation it does not recognise — a silently unparsed line is
a directory with zero coverage.

These tests query `git check-ignore`, i.e. git's own evaluation of the real
ignore rules, rather than re-implementing pattern matching. They run that
evaluation inside a THROWAWAY repo holding only this repository's own
`.gitignore` files, because `git check-ignore` in a live checkout also consults
`$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` and `core.excludesFile`. Both were measured to change
the verdict: a global `docs/architecture/*` rule turns the public assertions
red, and a matching contributor-local rule would keep the private assertions
green even with the repository rule deleted — i.e. the lock would silently stop
locking anything. Isolation is what makes the result a property of the
committed file rather than of whoever ran the suite.

They are install-agnostic: they need a git checkout and nothing else — no
services, no network, no local config.

# Can this suite actually DETECT the rule being broken?

#
# Twelve review findings landed on this file (PR #1633) and every one of them
# had the same shape: "replace the rule with <narrowing> and all 43 tests still
# pass while <a real path> becomes publishable". They are not twelve bugs. They
# are twelve reports that the SUITE'S PROBE CORPUS is thinner than the contract
# it claims to lock — and arguing corpus adequacy finding-by-finding is how a
# thirteenth arrives.
#
# So adequacy is MEASURED instead. Each mutation below is applied to a copy of
# the real `.gitignore`, the whole corpus is re-evaluated by git, and the suite
# fails if nothing flips. A mutation that survives is this file's bug, reported
# as this file's bug, before it is anyone else's.
#
# This is the same instrument as verify-RED, pointed at the suite rather than at
# one test: a lock nobody has watched fail is a lock nobody has tested.
