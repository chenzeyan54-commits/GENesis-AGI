"""Tests for the worktree ownership lever (scripts/hooks/worktree_claim.py).

The design rests on two claims about things this repo does not own -- that a
``git worktree lock`` stops the reaper, and that it stops ``git worktree
remove``. Both are exercised here against REAL git repositories rather than
mocks, because a mock of git would only prove that the mock agrees with the
belief being tested.

Every liveness test uses a CONTROL THAT MOVES. Asserting "a locked worktree was
skipped" on its own passes just as happily against a reaper that reaps nothing,
so each case runs the same worktree through the same command twice and differs
only by the lock.

The one thing deliberately NOT tested by spawning a real Claude Code session is
``session_pid_from_ancestry``. It is exercised against the live process tree
instead (the test process is itself a descendant of something), plus synthetic
``/proc`` readings, because spawning a session inside CI is neither available
nor reproducible.
