"""Regressions for three data-loss paths in the archiving reaper.

All three were review findings on a module whose stated contract is that it
deletes nothing, and all three break exactly that contract. Two share a root —
state changing between the moment a worktree is classified and the moment it is
acted on — which is why they are tested together rather than filed apart.

Each test pairs the failing case with a CONTROL that must move the other way.
"Archiving was skipped" on its own passes just as well against a reaper that
archives nothing, and "the tag exists" passes against one that tags
indiscriminately.
