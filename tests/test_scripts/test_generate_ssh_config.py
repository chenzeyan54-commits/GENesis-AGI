"""generate-ssh-config.sh: the client SSH config it emits.

The one-click "lobby" door (2026-08-14) adds a stable landing session that sees
every live cc-* slot, so a single reconnect after a client/reboot brings the
whole fleet back (the slots persist in tmux on the box). The load-bearing
invariant is ORDERING: the specific ``Host <host>-lobby`` block must precede the
``Host <host>-*`` wildcard, because ssh takes the FIRST matching RemoteCommand —
if the wildcard came first, ``<host>-lobby`` would route into cc-slot.sh and be
rejected as a non-numeric slot. These tests run the real script against a fake
`tailscale` on PATH: ``TestLobbyDoor`` exercises what the script *emits*, and
``TestSshResolution`` feeds that output to a real ``ssh -G`` so the actual
first-match *resolution* (not merely text order) is verified.

    An earlier design kept one persistent shared session named `lobby` and tried

    chooser goes stale), and sessions are shared (so a second window takes over
    the first). It respawned the pane to clear the first and took a lock plus an
    owner marker to serialise the second.

    Every defect this door has had came from that one choice. Making the door
    destructive forces a predicate for when destroying is safe, and there is no
    such predicate: an unattached pane can hold live work, and `Ctrl-b s` opens
    the chooser OVER a running process, so `mode=tree-mode` does not mean
    disposable either (MEASURED: `mode=[tree-mode] cmd=sleep`). Three successive
    predicates were each correct about their instance and wrong about the cause.

    A per-connection picker removes the cause. It cannot go stale because it is
