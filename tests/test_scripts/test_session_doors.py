"""Session doors: cc-slot.sh manual mode + the bootstrap bashrc wrapper.

WS-D2 (2026-07-16): every interactive door — SSH slot hostnames, manual SSH,
the dashboard web terminal — converges on cc-slot.sh's attach-or-create tmux
slots, replacing the uniquely-named `cc-manual-<ts>-<pid>` wrapper whose
never-reattach design manufactured orphans (and the duplicate-session guard
that papered over it, removed in the same change).

Behavioral tests run the real script against a fake `tmux` on PATH that
records its argv, so slot allocation, exact-name matching, arg forwarding,
and permission-flag suppression are exercised end-to-end rather than
asserted as text.
