"""SessionStart spawn seam for the zero-drop detector.

The detector cannot run in-hook: one gh round-trip plus ~160 worktree stats
(MEASURED ~19s) is orders of magnitude past the hook's 5s budget. So the hook's
entire job is one fire-and-forget Popen, and its entire contract is that a
detector failure can never cost anybody a session start.
