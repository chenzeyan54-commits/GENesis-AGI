"""install.sh: a SUCCESSFUL Qdrant install must not report a setup warning.

The defect this pins, found by the first run of the fresh-install CI check in
this same PR: the "Qdrant not found → install it" branch set ``SETUP_WARNINGS=1``
unconditionally at the end of the branch, outside the inner success/failure
if-chain. So a clean install printed

    + Qdrant 1.14.0 installed to /usr/local/bin/
    Genesis REQUIRES Qdrant for vector storage.

— the second line contradicting the first — and left the warning flag set. Under
``GENESIS_INSTALL_STRICT=1`` that is a guaranteed nonzero exit on every genuinely
fresh machine, i.e. the check could never be green.

Why it survived: a box that already has Qdrant takes the FIRST branch and never
reaches this code. Every developer box already has Qdrant. Only a fresh machine
reaches it, and nothing had installed Genesis on a fresh machine in ~12 weeks.

The branch is extracted from the shipped script and executed, so these tests
exercise the real control flow rather than a restatement of it. The only textual
substitution is the hardcoded ``/tmp`` path, redirected into the sandbox so a
test run cannot collide with a real download or with a concurrent test; the
if/else structure and the warn decision — what is actually under test — are
untouched.
