"""ci_failure_summary must name every failure, and must never fail itself.

The script runs only when the CI test job is ALREADY red, and its output is
the step summary — the one channel GitHub's log truncation cannot reach
(MEASURED 2026-09-14, run 34898229755: the log APIs dropped the tail of the
test step at ~44% of a 26,074-test run, and the tail is where pytest names
the failures). Two properties matter and both are asserted here:

* COMPLETENESS — every failed/errored testcase id is printed WHOLE. A summary
  that lists some of the failures reads as all of them. The single exception
  is GitHub's own 1 MiB step-summary cap, above which NOTHING is rendered;
  there the list is bounded to whole rows and the shortfall is stated with
  its denominator, so a bounded list never passes as a complete one. Both
  directions are asserted below — an implementation that always declared an
  omission would satisfy the cap test and fail the control.
* EXIT 0 ALWAYS — the job is already failing; a secondary exit code from the
  narrator would replace the real failure with a wrapper's. "Could not read
  the report" is carried by a printed notice, never by the code.
