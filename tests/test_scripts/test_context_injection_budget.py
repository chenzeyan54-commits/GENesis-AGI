"""The four-part context injection stays under the measured harness cap.

MEASURED 2026-08-30 on CC 2.1.246 (~25 real probe sessions): the harness FILES
a hook's stdout above EXACTLY 10,000 characters (10,000 inline / 10,001 filed;
chars not bytes — 6,000 two-byte chars = 12,044 B arrived inline) and the
budget is PER HOOK ENTRY (two 9,000-char hooks both arrived inline). Above the
cap the model receives a ~2 KB preview and the rest of that part simply never
arrives — the silent-context-loss class that ran unnoticed for a month.

These tests are the CI wall for that class: per-part payloads (with the REAL
tracked identity files) must fit, the four-entry wiring must exist in order,
and the degrade paths must be loud, not silent.
