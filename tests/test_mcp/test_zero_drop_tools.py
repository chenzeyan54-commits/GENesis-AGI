"""The read and disposition surfaces — without these the detector is inert.

A board nobody can read is not an answer to "what fell through the cracks?",
and a board nobody can disposition dies of alarm fatigue: the design has no
branch-name denylist by decision, so acknowledgement is the ONLY way to say
"this one is meant to sit there". The first build of this subsystem had a
detector, a store, a lifecycle and an alert that told the reader to run a tool
that did not exist.
