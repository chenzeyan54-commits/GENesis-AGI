"""Tests for the DM session-recovery context builder (real scroll-up recap).

Origin: 2026-08-18 — the user returned to a 5-day-old TARS thread and Genesis
couldn't see "option 3" because the recap truncated each message to its FIRST
300 chars while the numbered options sat at char ~3,850 of a 4,463-char reply.
The recap is now byte-budgeted and TAIL-biased (conclusions/option lists live
at the end of long analytical replies).
