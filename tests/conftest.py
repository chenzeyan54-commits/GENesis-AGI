# ── sys.path guard: tests must import from THIS worktree, not from main ──
# The venv has an editable install (``pip install -e .``) whose ``.pth``
# file adds ``/home/ubuntu/genesis/src`` — the MAIN worktree's src — to
# ``sys.path`` at interpreter startup. Without this guard, running
# ``pytest`` from a sibling worktree collects tests from the worktree's
# ``tests/`` directory but imports ``genesis.*`` from main's source tree.
# The tests silently lie: they report PASS/FAIL against the wrong code.
#
# This block inserts the current worktree's own ``src`` at ``sys.path``
# position 0 before any test collects. pytest loads conftest.py during
# the collection phase, before any test module runs, and before the
# fixtures below import ``genesis.*``. Position 0 beats the editable
# install's path.
#
# Safety:
# - In the main worktree ``_WORKTREE_SRC`` resolves to the same directory
#   as the editable install's ``.pth``-injected path. The guard removes
#   and re-inserts that path at position 0 — a reorder, not a true no-op,
#   but semantically equivalent because only one ``genesis/`` package
#   exists on ``sys.path``. Import resolution is unchanged.
# - In a sibling worktree it shadows the editable install so tests resolve
#   against the worktree's source tree, which is what every test author
#   expects.
# - This is the structural fix for the 2026-04-10 worktree-test-isolation
#   footgun: before this guard, every sibling-worktree test run needed an
#   explicit ``PYTHONPATH=src`` prefix or it silently tested main instead.

    Kept as a predicate rather than inlined so the exemption set is one
    reviewable list; see the caller for why these must not be blocked.

    ``version`` is deliberately NOT in that list, which is not obvious. MEASURED
    across two pytest versions, because the project pins only ``pytest>=8.0`` and
    the behaviour differs between them:

    * ``--version`` — ``Config.main()`` short-circuits it (it matches the literal
      token at count 1) before the infrastructure starts, so we never run.
      Same on 9.0.3 and 9.1.1.
    * ``--version --version`` / ``-VV`` — ``helpconfig.pytest_cmdline_main``
      returns at ``version > 1``, before ``_do_configure()``. Again never run.
    * ``-V`` — VERSION-DEPENDENT, and that is the whole reason this note exists.
      On 9.0.3 neither branch fires (``Config.main`` matches the *string*
      ``--version``, and ``version == 1`` is not ``> 1``), so it falls through to
      ``wrap_session`` and runs the WHOLE SUITE. On 9.1.1 pytest answers it early
      and this hook never loads.

    Removing ``version`` is right under EITHER behaviour: where ``-V`` never
    reaches us the entry is simply dead, and where it does reach us it is a full
    unserialized suite that exempting would wave straight past the lock — the
    opposite of the point. It reads like a harmless entry, which is why the
    measurement is written down rather than left to the next reader's intuition,
    and why the test guarding it asserts the safety PROPERTY (``-V`` never runs a
    session past a held lock) rather than either version's mechanism. An earlier
    version of that test encoded 9.0.3's behaviour and failed on CI's 9.1.1.

    calls ``merge_local_overlay`` resolves them from two locations, and BOTH
    leak into tests unpatched — green on CI (no overlays), red or falsely green
    on a live install:

    1. **User dir** (``~/.genesis/config/*.local.yaml``) — absolute, so it leaks
       in the main tree AND in a sibling worktree. Patched by redirecting
       ``_user_config_dir`` to an empty per-test dir.
    2. **Repo-relative sibling** (``<repo>/config/*.local.yaml``) — gitignored,
       present only in the main tree, so a worktree test run structurally can't
       catch it. When a loader is called with a real repo config path (e.g.
       ``load_ego_config()`` with no args → ``repo_root()/config/ego.yaml``),
       ``_resolve_overlay_path`` falls back to the real sibling. We wrap the
       resolver so any overlay that resolves INSIDE the real repo config dir is
       redirected to the empty dir. tmp-rooted overlays (the overlay tests'
       own fixtures, and ``test_config_save``-style tests) are never touched.

    ``security/immunity.py`` binds ``_user_config_dir`` at module level (its own
    reference), so it is patched separately. The guards in
    tests/test_config_overlay.py keep this list complete and catch any NEW
    hand-rolled ``.local.yaml`` resolver that bypasses ``merge_local_overlay``.
    Independent resolvers (routing, recon, mcp settings) hold their own logic
    and are tracked for consolidation (follow-up); the MCP ``_USER_CONFIG_DIR``
    constants are excluded as too import-heavy for an every-test fixture — their
    tests self-isolate.

    ``test_learned_knobs``) would otherwise also revert THIS suite-isolation

    ``dataclasses._is_type`` dereferences ``sys.modules.get(cls.__module__)``,
    which is ``None`` for an unregistered module. Do not take that on trust from
    this docstring — ``tests/test_private_module.py`` locks it, and deleting the
    ``sys.modules[name] = mod`` line below fails there.

    Leaving the name registered is the leak this exists to prevent: pytest
    imports every test module at COLLECTION, so the last registration wins for
    the session, and a ``monkeypatch.setattr`` can then land on a different
    object than a call-time ``from <name> import ...`` resolves. Two locks in
    ``tests/test_hooks/test_escalation_cap.py`` assert exactly that for
    ``review_state`` and ``review_scope``.

    Prefer this over hand-rolling register/exec/restore: N call sites each
    remembering to restore is a convention, and conventions break one instance
    at a time.

    LIMIT, and it is real, because the instruction to prefer this helper routes
    you into it. A class defined in the loaded module resolves its string
    annotations against whatever ``sys.modules`` holds AFTER the restore, and the
    restore has TWO branches with different — and differently dangerous —
    outcomes for an annotation naming a module-level symbol:

    * name previously UNBOUND -> the entry is popped, and
      ``typing.get_type_hints`` (plus anything built on it: pydantic,
      ``inspect.signature(eval_str=True)``) raises ``NameError``. Loud.
    * name previously BOUND -> the PREVIOUS object is put back, so resolution
      SUCCEEDS against the canonical module and returns a same-named class from
      a different module object. Silent, and worse for that reason.

    ``dataclasses.fields`` is unaffected in both. Documented rather than locked,
    deliberately: the test that once pinned these two branches had to exec every
    carrier under ``scripts/`` to find them, which pulled a module-level
    ``load_dotenv(override=True)`` into the test process and replaced environment
    variables for everything collected after it — a worse defect than the caveat
    it was verifying. An earlier revision of this paragraph also asserted the
    first outcome unconditionally, which is wrong about the second — and the
    second is the SILENT one, which is why it is written down here.

    So if the script under test needs late annotation resolution, it is not a
    private-module candidate. (An earlier revision also claimed the opposite of
    the limit entirely — "5/5, no failures" — from four modules picked by hand
    for being easy to exec rather than from the population. Recorded because the
    convenience sample IS the failure mode, and it becomes invisible the moment
    it is written as a number.)

    leaves the rest of the population exactly as it was.

    ITS node ids over the outer session's file, so after the child exits a hard
    crash in the still-running outer test is reported under the child's last

    what makes a nested run stand down. The idiom already exists here:
    ``pytest_lock``'s HELD_ENV does the same job for the box-wide lock, and its
    tests pop it precisely so a child stops mistaking itself for the outer run.
