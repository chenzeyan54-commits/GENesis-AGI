"""The distance is the DEPLOYED tree's, and a failed measurement says so.

Two properties, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong. The count
must be `HEAD..origin/main` — the reader's own distance — rather than the span
between two release tags. And when git cannot produce that count, the endpoint
must REFUSE to answer with a number: 0 renders as "up to date" and clears a
known update, 1 fabricates a distance nobody measured. Both wear the grammar of
a measurement, which is precisely the defect this endpoint was changed to stop.
