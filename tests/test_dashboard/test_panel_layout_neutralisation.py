"""The two declarations that undo the inherited viewport and panel layout.

`index.css` is inherited from another project and loads first on every page. Two
of its rules are written for an app shell and are wrong for an ordinary document:

    body, html { overflow: hidden; position: fixed; height: 100% }
    .panel     { display: flex; height: 100% }

The first makes a page unscrollable. The second lays a panel's header BESIDE its
body instead of above it — MEASURED in a browser before the fix, the Zero-Drop
header box was 261x882 px inside a panel ~1350 px wide, putting the title some
440 px below the top of the box it names.

Neither errors and neither logs. Three separate pages carried one or the other
for months, each found by a person looking at a page.

These tests pin the ANSWER and nothing else. They deliberately do not model the
cascade: a general lint that does was built alongside this fix, was found
fail-open in four consecutive reviews, and lives on its own branch until it
converges. What is here instead is the narrow, checkable thing — the answer
exists, on the sheet every page loads, after the sheet it answers, and it says
what it has to say.

WHAT THE EXTRACTOR BELOW DOES AND DOES NOT MODEL, stated because the first two
versions of this file both claimed more than they performed. It resolves, for one
selector and one property, the declaration a browser would use IF no other
selector also matched the element: comments removed, at-rules removed, every
top-level rule whose selector list CONTAINS that selector considered in document
order, last declaration winning. It knows nothing about specificity, about a
different selector that happens to match the same element, or about other sheets.
A rule reached only through a MORE specific selector is therefore invisible here,
by choice — that is the cascade model this file refuses to carry.
