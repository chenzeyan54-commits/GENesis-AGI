"""Every ``/v1/*`` route refuses an anonymous caller — enumerated, not spot-checked.

``dashboard/auth.py`` exempts the whole ``/v1/*`` prefix from the dashboard
SESSION gate, because machine callers have no browser session. The comment beside
``check_bearer_token`` says it exists "so a new ``/v1/*`` surface cannot quietly
ship without one" — but nothing enforced that, and a convention several authors
must each remember is exactly what a fourth blueprint quietly breaks.

POLARITY IS ALLOWLIST in both directions. Routes are discovered from a live
``url_map``, and the BLUEPRINTS that map is built from are discovered by PARSING
the production registration site rather than restated in a tuple here.

The claim is bounded on purpose, because the unbounded version of it has now
been wrong twice. An earlier version listed three blueprints by hand and said a
fourth was "covered by construction"; it was not — a fourth would never have
been registered here at all. The version after that parsed production but
recognised only two call shapes, while a THIRD shape was already in the file it
parsed, so a blueprint arriving that way was still skipped in silence. What
holds now is narrower and checkable: the three registration shapes production
actually uses are resolved, and a call this parser cannot resolve FAILS the
suite instead of disappearing from it. A fourth shape is covered only once it
is added below — the assertion is what makes that visible rather than silent.

A route that needs to be public must be named in ``_PUBLIC`` with a reason,
which makes the exemption reviewable instead of invisible.

Origin: one of these three endpoints shipped with no auth at all while
authenticating nothing, on a port bound 0.0.0.0, invoking Claude Code.

    """Every blueprint the production app factory registers, by PARSING it.

    ``hosting/standalone.py::_register_blueprints`` is the one place that
    decides what the served app contains. Reading it — rather than restating it
    here — is what makes a surface added later covered rather than merely
    claimed: a new ``/v1`` blueprint registered there appears in this list
    automatically, and its routes then have to satisfy the assertions below.

    Two registration shapes are recognised, because production uses both:
    ``app.register_blueprint(NAME)`` with NAME imported inside the function, and
    an adapter that registers its own (``OpenClawAdapter().register_blueprints``),
    which is how the OpenClaw completions endpoint arrives.

    Every failure to reach a registration target — import, construction, or the
    registration call itself — is FATAL here, naming what it could not load. A
    skipped target is indistinguishable from an absent one, and the named-path
    checks below would pass straight around the hole. The test is deliberately
    stricter than production, which logs and continues: production degrading is
    correct, a contract test degrading proves nothing.
