"""Every dashboard tab is wired into ALL of its registries.

Adding a tab needs coordinated edits across `dashboard.js`, the page template
and the nav chrome, and NOTHING verified them until this file. That matters
more than it sounds, because the two worst failures are SILENT:

  * missing from the `valid` array  -> the hash router rejects the tab and
    falls back to Overview, so the nav button appears to do nothing;
  * missing its `_startTabIntervals` case -> the panel renders and never
    fetches, so it sits permanently empty with no error anywhere.

Neither raises, neither logs, and no route test can see either — a tab wired
into zero JS registries still passes every HTTP test of its endpoint.

MEASURED when this file was written: 18 tabs, of which `sessions` was missing
from `_tabInitialized` (fixed in the same commit so this lands green). That
drift was benign — Alpine's proxy tolerates the absent key — which is exactly
why it survived: nothing was broken enough to notice.

WHY SET EQUALITY AND NOT A LOOP OVER `valid`. The first version of this file
iterated the `valid` array and checked each tab against the other registries.
Its own verify-RED killed it: deleting a tab FROM `valid` left the suite GREEN,
because the deleted tab simply stopped being iterated — the single most
dangerous omission was the one shape the test could not see. A test whose
universe is one of the things it checks silently shrinks instead of failing.

So the universe is the UNION of three INDEPENDENT sources — the router
whitelist, the nav buttons, and the template includes — and each source must
equal it. Removing a tab from any one of them now breaks the equality from the
other two.

Deliberately a TEXT parse rather than a JS engine: the store is one 5000-line
object literal, and the alternative is executing the dashboard's JS in a
runtime none of CI has. The parses are pinned by
`test_registries_are_parseable_at_all`, so a refactor that defeats this file
fails loudly instead of silently passing.
