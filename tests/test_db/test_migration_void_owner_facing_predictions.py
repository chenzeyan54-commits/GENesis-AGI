"""Migration 20260904213255 — void historical owner-facing outreach predictions.

The outreach ledger hook wrote reply_received/positive_engagement predictions for every
delivered send, including owner-facing pings (Telegram/voice), which never get an external
reply and so pin the recomputed reply-rate calibration near 0%. The migration sets
status='void' for outreach_send predictions whose originating outreach_history.channel is
owner-facing (telegram/voice); calibration_cells recompute from resolved rows only, so
voided rows drop out automatically. External-channel predictions (email/discord) are
untouched. Idempotent; table-absent-safe.
