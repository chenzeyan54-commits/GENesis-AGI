    now. The patch then lands on nobody and the real function runs — a failure
    invisible in a single-file run and visible only in the full suite, in
    collection order.

    Asserting the premise directly means the next unrestored hijack fails HERE,
    naming the cause, instead of surfacing as a bewildering assertion in an
    unrelated test. `tests.conftest.private_module` is the supported way to load
