"""Fail-closed blind-spot net for the parser's quoting blind spot.

The parser's model of one quoting form is narrower than the shell's, so a
command can segment differently from the way it executes. When that happens the
real git segment is absent from the parse, and the gates that look for one see
the same empty result they would see if no git command were present at all --
they no-op, which is a fail-OPEN. The cases are held as fixture data below
rather than described here; the property that matters is that an empty parse is
not evidence of absence.

The fix nets around the blind spot in the CALLERS (shell_parse's own ANSI-C fix
is a separate follow-up): when a command is not cleanly parseable AND mentions a
gated op AND the parse surfaced no matching segment, the guard REFUSES the
command -- exit 2, for every session type, interactive included.

The refusal is the whole design, not a fallback for unattended sessions. USER
RULING 2026-09-08: hooks are for the AGENT, not the user; the only prompt a
human ever sees from these guards is the deliberate push / PR-create egress
approval, which is unchanged and out of scope here. The earlier design asked
interactively and priced a false positive in one USER confirmation; this one
prices it in an AGENT rewrite that the refusal message spells out (the Write
tool for prose, ``-F <file>`` for a real git command). Same broad predicate,
no prompt.

The predicate stays broad on purpose. A hard block that had to be surgically
precise about which unparseable commands are real could not exist -- precision
is exactly what an unreliable parse cannot deliver, and three rounds of
narrowing conjuncts each became a new way to starve the trigger. What makes a
broad trigger affordable is no longer "somebody clicks approve" but "the
message names a rewrite the session can perform unaided".

The invariants below are therefore:

* a bypass shape must NEVER be a silent allow;
* an inert mention inside an unparseable command IS refused -- in every session
  type, with no mode axis left -- and the refusal must be ACTIONABLE, naming
  both the cause and a rewrite that applies, so the session can proceed without
  a human. That is what makes it a cost rather than a wall, and it is asserted,
  never assumed.

The second invariant used to read "a benign shape must NEVER be a hard block".
That was written from the interactive path and is now retired outright: nothing
distinguishes the modes any more, so there is no path on which a benign
unparseable mention is merely asked about.

Trigger literals are assembled from fragments so this file's own text does not
carry them (matches the convention in test_shell_parse.py).

    Gates that read repo state (branch, remote, pushed-ness) use the process
    cwd, so a payload-only cwd silently evaluated them against whatever
    directory pytest ran from — this worktree, whose branch IS pushed. That made
    a `gh pr create` control report "already on the remote" and look un-gated,

    the false-positive cost it exists to bound tripled unseen. Dispatch mode was
    then not a parameter at all, so the cell where those asks became REFUSALS
    did not exist in the grid; an external audit found it. Adding the axis
    turned the dispatched half red and the honest reading was that the invariant
    was wrong, not the guard: three rounds of narrowing the predicate could not
    make "a benign shape is never hard blocked" true, because the blind path
    cannot tell an executed verb from a quoted one — which is the premise of the
    net existing.

    The 2026-09-08 user ruling settles it for both halves rather than only the
    unattended one: hooks are for the agent and do not prompt, so the interactive
    `ask` is retired and these cells refuse too. The false positive is now priced
    in an agent rewrite instead of a user click — which is exactly why (c) is a
    hard assertion and not a comment. A refusal with no usable rewrite would make
    this a wall for every session, not just the unattended ones.

    The cells split on the PARSE, not on the mode: where the command tokenizes
    (or analyze() resolved the op anyway) the net stands down and the ordinary
    rules allow, which is correct — nothing gated executes. MEASURED across the
    24 combinations: the three untokenizable contexts refuse in both modes, and
    `in_double_quotes` allows in both.

# The net must never DOWNGRADE an existing hard block to a prompt.
#
# The net is evaluated where analyze() found no gated segment, which is also
# true for commands other rules hard-block (a direct sqlite write, a commit
# hook-skip). Returning an `ask` from inside the net pre-empted those rules and
# turned a policy block into a dialog — measured, and invisible to invariants
# that only assert "not silently allowed". These pin the verdict exactly.
#
# Under the 2026-09-08 ruling the net's verdict is a DENY rather than an ask, so
# a downgrade to a dialog is no longer possible at all. But the net still sets
# `blind_spot_deny` and DEFERS it to the tail rather than returning inline, and
# that deferral is the whole reason the REASON stays correct: every specific
# hard block above it returns first and prints its own sharper cause.
#
# So there are two independent properties here, and the second one used to be
# only a comment. Both are asserted below:
#   1. the VERDICT is still `block` (what these tests always covered), and
#   2. the MESSAGE is the specific rule's, not the net's generic
#      "cannot be parsed safely" text.
#
# (2) is what an inline `return 2` inside the net would silently break — same
# block, worse reason — and nothing else in this file would have gone red.
# The apostrophe_comment cells are the ones that matter: they make the command
# untokenizable AND mention a gated op, so the net genuinely arms and the two
# candidate messages actually race.

# its value (`i += 2`) and every other `-`-prefixed token alone (`i += 1`). So
# an option missing from the table is ASSUMED valueless, and if it really does
# consume a value, that value lands in the verb slot: the walk reports it as the
# subcommand, the real verb is never reached, and every gate keyed on the
# subcommand stands down.
#
# This is not an exotic-quoting case — the command below is written out in full.
# The option set was MEASURED against the installed git rather than read from
# `git -h`, which omits `--attr-source` entirely while git accepts it.
