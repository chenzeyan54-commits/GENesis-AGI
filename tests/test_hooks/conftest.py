def _fresh_proactive_writer():
    """Give every test its own BoundedStdout for the proactive memory hook.

    That hook holds its writer in a module-level singleton, which is right in
    PRODUCTION (one hook invocation per process) and wrong under pytest, where
    one module is imported once and every test would then share — and slowly
    spend — a single 9,800-character budget. The failure is the nastiest kind:
    the test that happens to run when the budget runs out sees its output CUT
    and fails for a reason that has nothing to do with what it asserts, and
    which test that is depends on collection order.

    Reset rather than reconstruct, so a test asserting on ``_writer()`` state
    (emitted totals, whether a cut happened) starts from zero.

    READS ``sys.modules``; DOES NOT IMPORT. An autouse fixture runs for every
    test in this directory, and importing the hook is not free: the module is an
    executable script whose import-time body calls ``load_dotenv`` on the real
    ``secrets.env`` and then ``sys.exit(0)`` when ``GENESIS_CC_SESSION=1``.
    MEASURED: with that variable set — which is exactly what a dispatched
    background session exports — importing here turned
    ``tests/test_hooks/test_file_context_hook.py`` from 5 passed into 5 ERRORS,
    in a file that has nothing to do with this hook. ``SystemExit`` does not
    inherit from ``Exception``, so no plausible ``except`` around the import
    would have contained it either.

    Looking the module up instead is not a weaker version of the same thing: a
    test module that needs the writer has already imported it AT COLLECTION,
    which happens before any fixture runs, so the lookup finds it whenever it
    matters. When it is absent there is no writer to reset and nothing to warn
    about — the previous revision warned on that path, which was noise for every
    test in this directory that legitimately never touches the hook.

    The reader shells out to ``gh pr view`` for the body and for ``createdAt``, so
    without this pin each test that drives the merge arm or its report would make a
    LIVE call: green on a dev box with gh authenticated and PR "1" answering, red in
    CI, and in both cases testing the network rather than the thing under test.

    Since 2026-09-06 the E2E reader is advisory, so ITS verdict cannot fail a merge
    and what this prevents for that gate is NOTE noise, not a false block.

    But do not read that as "nothing here can fail a merge" — an earlier version of
    this docstring said exactly that and it is FALSE. ``_TEST_GH_PR_BODY`` is a
    SHARED seam: ``_check_pin_receipts`` reads the same body via ``_pr_body_text``
    and DOES block. MEASURED 2026-09-06 — feeding it this fixture's body with a
    forward pin returns blocked=True ("CC pin moves FORWARD … but the PR body is
    missing 2 required gate receipt(s)"). So changing or deleting the default here
    silently changes what every pin-gate test in this directory is fed; edit it only
    with those tests in view.

    Still the hermetic default rather than a waiver: the E2E reader's own behaviour
    (every classification, both report directions, the cutoff, the degraded path) is
    exercised in tests/test_hooks/test_e2e_plan_gate.py, which overrides these per

    a shape that happens to parse to zero findings. Those tests would then pass
    for an accidental reason and would start failing the day an unrelated fixture
    changed its payload.

    Empty is the honest default: a test that says nothing about outside-diff
    findings should see none. The channel's own behaviour — every severity, both
    fail directions, dedupe, and the dismissed-review rule — is exercised in

    are LIVE ``gh`` calls: green on a dev box with gh authenticated, red in CI,
    and slow either way, so every existing freshness test would be testing the
    network.

    The contribution seam defaults to ``{}``, which resolves to None for any
    revision pair → the refinement declines to rescue → existing tests keep the
    exact verdicts they were written for. That is the fail-CLOSED direction, so

def offdiff_lock(capsys, monkeypatch):
    """FAIL a hook test that silently discounted a finding as outside the diff.

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR. The merge gate scores a review finding only when
    its path is in the PR's changed-file set; a finding on any other path is
    routed to the off-diff lane, surfaced as a NOTE and never scored
    (``_off_diff``, checked BEFORE the doc-path lever on both the P1 branch and
    the P2 branch). Tests pin that changed-file set with a FIXED allowlist
    (``_TEST_GH_PR_FILES``). So a test anchoring a finding on a path the
    allowlist forgot does not fail — it quietly routes off-diff, and a bare
    ``assert not block`` then passes VACUOUSLY, proving nothing about the
    exemption it is named for. Measured live on PR #1690.

    Until this fixture, the only defence was PROSE — a fixture docstring and a
    standing comment asking every not-block test to also assert its lane marker
    — and 3 tests already did not. A rule every call site must REMEMBER is a
    convention; this makes forgetting fail.

    MECHANISM, and why it is this one. The lane writes to stderr, and
    ``_check_inline_review_findings`` returns only ``(should_block, message)``,
    so the routing is invisible to the assertion. Reading ``capsys`` after
    ``yield`` does NOT work: ~20 of the exposed tests call ``readouterr()`` in
    the body, which DRAINS the buffer. Wrapping ``sys.stderr`` does not work
    either — MEASURED at 0 of 4 chunks recorded, because pytest reinstalls
    ``sys.stdout``/``sys.stderr`` per test PHASE, discarding a fixture-setup
    wrap before the call phase runs. Wrapping ``readouterr`` itself is what
    survives both: every drain is recorded, and a final drain at teardown
    catches what a test never read.

    THREE LIMITS, stated rather than papered over — and note the first is the
    only one that fails SILENTLY, which is why it is first:

    * **It fails OPEN.** A ``MARKER`` that no longer matches the guard's labels,
      or a pytest change that breaks the ``readouterr`` wrap, makes this fixture
      pass everything and say nothing — the exact shape it exists to stop, one
      layer up. That is the right trade (failing closed would break every hook
      test on any capture hiccup), but it means the lock's value rests entirely
      on ``TestOffDiffLockItself`` in test_merge_review_gate.py staying honest.
      Treat those tests as load-bearing machinery, not as coverage: they are all
      that stands between this fixture working and this fixture being inert.
    * It cannot see a guard run in a CHILD process — ``_run_guard``'s subprocess
      tests capture the child's stderr into a ``CompletedProcess``, which never
      passes through ``capsys``. No path-anchored finding lives there today, so
      the gap is currently empty; it is a gap all the same. Fails closed in the
      sense that matters: those tests are simply not covered, not wrongly passed.
    * Requesting ``capsys`` here makes it active for EVERY hook test, and pytest
      refuses ``capsys`` and ``capfd`` in one test — loudly, as a setup ERROR.
      Measured 0 uses of ``capfd``/``capsysbinary`` in all of ``tests/`` when
      this landed, so a future test needing ``capfd`` is what will collide, and
      the fix then is to narrow this fixture's scope, not to delete the opt-in.
