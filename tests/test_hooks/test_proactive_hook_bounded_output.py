"""The proactive memory hook's model-facing stdout is bounded, per surface.

This hook runs on EVERY prompt in EVERY foreground session and writes bare
stdout to a UserPromptSubmit event, so everything it prints reaches the model
directly — and the harness FILES a hook entry over ``HOOK_STDOUT_CAP`` behind a
~2 KB preview with no error and no exit-code change. A breach here is silent and
costs the window its peer list and its prompt-injection safety directive.

Four surfaces were unbounded, and they fail differently, which is why each gets
its own bound rather than one blanket cap:

* the keyword window  — ``prompt`` is arbitrary user text and every keyword was
  length-unbounded, so ONE pasted alphanumeric run became one token;
* the trail LINE      — bounded keywords still allow fifty wide labels;
* the code hint       — ``code_symbols.signature`` has no cap, and this is the
  largest surface MEASURED on real data rather than on a pasted worst case;
* the peer block      — ``get_active_sync`` had no ``LIMIT``.

Every number asserted here is derived in the docstring of the function that owns
it. The tests pin BEHAVIOUR (bounded, whole-unit selection, loud overflow), and
re-assert the constants only where a claim depends on their arithmetic.
