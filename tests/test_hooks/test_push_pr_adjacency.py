"""The push guard's PR-adjacency hygiene: no silent public branch without a PR.

Two mechanisms, both measured on this repo before they were built:

  * A public branch with no open PR runs no CI and no leak-detector at all
    (ci.yml triggers on pull_request), which is the exact state the repo's
    publish rule exists to prevent.

The design constraint these tests pin is the FAIL DIRECTION, per finding:

  * `_open_pr_count_for_branch` distinguishes 0 (measured: no PR) from None
    (unanswerable). Only a measured 0 downgrades the silent re-push allow to an
    ask; None keeps the status quo, because this is a hygiene prompt on an
    already-approved branch, not a security boundary, and a network blip must
    not manufacture prompts.
  * The count refuses to answer rather than guess: a FULL result window is a
    truncated read, and a push destination that is not the repository gh
    resolved is a different question entirely. Both return None.

Subprocess seams are patched via a recording fake rather than by running gh:
these tests must pass on a fresh clone with no network and no gh auth.
