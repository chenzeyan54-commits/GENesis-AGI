"""Consistency LOCK for the value-flag specs duplicated across the guard hooks.

The pr-merge / push / commit guards each carry their OWN copy of the gh/git
"value-flag" sets — the flags that consume the FOLLOWING argv token as their
value (so a scan for a positional/binding does not misread that value). Those
copies MUST stay identical across files: a flag added to one copy but not the
others is exactly the parse divergence that let the separated ``-R`` form
bypass every fail-closed merge gate (``gh pr -R o/r merge N --admin``, #1385
round-5).

This test is the drift TRIP-WIRE. Physical de-duplication (one shared spec) is
deliberately deferred to the gate-core extraction (S3) — which restructures
these files anyway; until then this lock makes the next silent drift a RED CI
check instead of a live bypass.

If this test FAILS: you changed ONE copy of a value-flag set. Update ALL copies
named in the failing assertion so they match again — they are intentionally
identical, not coincidentally so.
