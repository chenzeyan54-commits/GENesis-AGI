"""The discarded-command note: behaviour, fail-open contract, and wiring locks.

The wiring locks are the load-bearing half. A note helper that is imported but
never called, or a guard that was never wired at all, is indistinguishable from a
working one until the day it matters — so the coverage set is derived from
`.claude/settings.json` (the CONFIGURATION) rather than from the modules that
happen to import the helper, which is structurally blind to a blocker nobody
wired.

    """Locks the one invariant an upstream refactor could have broken silently.

    When `_main_with_note` was written, all 28 `return 2` sites were inside
    `main`. Upstream then extracted them into `_run_merge_and_push_gates`, so
    `main` now has ZERO of them and the wrapper's correctness rests entirely on
    `main` returning the gate's own rc unchanged. Nothing asserted that: the
    wrapper's other tests are string assertions over source, and the live
    exception test exercises only the `except` branch.

    This drives the real guard to a real refusal and asserts the note arrives —
    so if a future refactor makes `main` swallow or translate the gate's code,
    this fails instead of the note quietly vanishing from 28 sites at once.

    The payload is deterministic and needs no network: requesting a Codex review
    on an unresolvable PR target is refused by the identity check.
