"""The escalation cap's menu, put to the user in the gate's own words.

WHY THIS EXISTS. On 2026-08-31 the cap printed three remedies and the session's relay
to the user dropped the first, invented a fourth, and added "ship as-is" -- the one
outcome the cap exists to prevent.

WHAT IS AND IS NOT COVERED, stated here because the scope IS the design. The hook reads
the existing branch-scoped review-round counter and appends the gate's own question when
the CAP tier is live. There is no persisted marker, so there is no lifecycle to test --
no write, no read-back, no retirement, no scoping, no validation of stored data. Two
earlier designs carried all of that and it drew ~25 findings across four reviewers
against ~3 for the substitution itself; the last was a P1 that made the marker's headline
mechanism inoperative in production while its own tests passed. What replaced it answers
the marker's one real question -- which tier is live -- from state that already exists.

The round-2 mode-switch tier is deliberately NOT covered, and one test below pins that
exclusion WITH its reason, because it is the load-bearing scope decision rather than an
omission.
