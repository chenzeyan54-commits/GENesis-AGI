"""The leaks gate honours an ANCESTOR accepted marker when the mechanical scanner
is green at the CURRENT head.

WHY the relief exists. The scheduled routines are not re-run on a push, so on any
multi-push PR the marker sits at the first head and the gate blocks. Measured over
ten recent PRs: every one with commits after its marker was blocked, and the only
escape was `# scheduled-review-override` -- a sigil that verifies NOTHING. Routine
use of an exception valve is worse than a narrower rule.

WHY IT IS SAFE. The two layers catch different leak classes: the mechanical scan
catches literal patterns and runs per-head; the scheduled LLM review catches
inferential leaks. Carrying the LLM verdict forward while REQUIRING the mechanical
one at this exact commit is strictly more checking than the bare override.

THREE PROPERTIES CARRY THAT SAFETY, and each has its own tests below, because
relief granted on the wrong cell silently weakens an irreducible gate:
  * ANCESTRY -- "an earlier head of this PR" is NOT "a sha that differs from
    head". A force-push or rewriting rebase leaves the reviewed commit off the
    branch, so the PR can carry a wholly different tree while the old marker still
    names a real commit. Carrying it would vouch for code no reviewer saw.
  * IDENTITY -- a check is trusted on (name, workflowName), never display name
    alone; a same-named check from another workflow must not stand in for the
    scanner. Same decoy class this file's _ci_identity already documents.
  * HONEST REPORTING -- a carried-forward review must never be rendered as one
    made at head.

Network-free via the _TEST_GH_* env-injection seams.

class TestWorkflowDisplayNameIsUniqueProvenance:
    """Codex P1: `(name, workflowName)` is only unique provenance while no two workflow
    FILES share one display name — and GitHub does not require that.

    ESTABLISHED, not assumed. GitHub's workflow-syntax reference documents `name:` as
    "The name of the workflow. GitHub displays the names of your workflows under your
    repository's Actions tab. If you omit name, GitHub displays the workflow file path
    relative to the root of the repository." No uniqueness constraint is stated
    anywhere on that page, so two files CAN both declare `name: CI`.

    Why that matters HERE specifically: a decoy file named `CI` publishing a job named
    `leak-detector` would share the scanner's tuple, so its SUCCESS could supersede the
    real scanner's CANCELLED in `_drop_superseded_cancels` AND then satisfy the pin in
    `_mechanical_scan_is_green`. Before this PR the relief path had no drop at all, so
    both entries were collected and the cancel blocked; the extraction is what makes a
    decoy able to erase a real cancellation. That widening is real and it is why this
    guard exists.

    Unique provenance DOES exist in GitHub's GraphQL schema —
    `checkSuite.workflowRun.workflow.databaseId` and `checkSuite.workflowRun.file.path`
    — but `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` does NOT expose it. MEASURED: a rollup
    entry carries exactly `__typename, completedAt, conclusion, detailsUrl, name,
    startedAt, status, workflowName`. `detailsUrl` embeds a RUN id, which is unique per
    run but does not identify the workflow FILE — two runs of the same file also differ
    — so it cannot separate a decoy from a legitimate re-run without a second API call.
    Pinning on real provenance therefore means abandoning `gh pr view --json` for a raw
    GraphQL query: a rewrite of this gate's read path, not a fix inside this PR.

    So this guard closes the PRECONDITION instead of the consequence, which is cheap and
    complete for the reachable case: `workflowName` is populated only for GitHub Actions
    check-runs, and Actions check-runs on this repo's commits come from this repo's own
    workflow files. A non-Actions app's check-run has no workflowName, so `_ci_identity`
    returns None and it can never be a sibling. Note `.github/workflows/` is NOT on the
    hook surface (`_HOOK_SURFACE_PREFIXES`), so a new workflow file gets no extra review
    — this test is the only thing that would catch the collision."""

        produce the identical tuple just as easily, and nothing in GitHub's syntax
        forbids it: `jobs.<id>.name` has no uniqueness constraint either. If an
