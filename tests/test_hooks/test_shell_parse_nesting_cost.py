"""``analyze``'s cost must be bounded, because guards run it against a hard timeout.

Every PreToolUse guard is registered with a wall-clock timeout in
``.claude/settings.json`` (10s for the destructive/protected-path guards). A hook
killed at that timeout never reaches its ``exit 2``, and Claude Code reads any
non-2 exit as NON-blocking — so a guard that runs out of time does not refuse the
command, it PERMITS it. Cost is therefore a security property of this parser, not
a performance concern.

``analyze`` recurses once per nesting level and re-scans the remaining text at each
level, so its cost is length x depth — and the padding SHAPE moves it another 3.4x
(comment-padded 3.21s vs quoted-padded 9.64s at the same depth and length). A depth
quoted without a length and a shape is therefore not a measurement.

MEASURED on ``origin/main`` before this fix, end to end against the real
``protected_paths_guard``, on a payload it genuinely blocks (a protected data
directory) padded with a quoted string to 65,400 chars, under the guard's registered
10s timeout:

    depth   0  exit 2 refused   0.46s
    depth  32  exit 2 refused   6.78s
    depth  48  exit 2 refused   9.96s
    depth 128  KILLED at 10s -> non-2 -> the tool call PROCEEDS

The payload must name a genuinely protected path or the test is vacuous: an
unprotected path returns exit 0 at every depth, and timing an allow proves nothing.

The crossing needs a command longer than anything real (at 43,480 chars, the longest
of 45,956 real commands, the unbounded parse stays well inside the budget), so it is
reachable by a CRAFTED command rather than by ordinary work — which for a security
guard is the threat model, not a mitigation.

The fix bounds the WORK rather than a proxy for it, and — critically — SIGNALS when
it truncated. Silently capping the recursion would trade this fail-open for a worse
one: the guard would stop seeing a nested ``rm`` past the cap and allow it happily.
The signal mirrors ``untokenizable()``, which exists for exactly this reason.

The signal comes from the PARSE, never from a second opinion about the parse. An
earlier draft predicted the depth with a hand-written counter; two shapes defeated it
(quoted parens and ``$(( … ))`` arithmetic each depressed the count below the real
depth while ``analyze`` truncated anyway), which is a silent all-clear on a buried
``rm`` — strictly worse than the timeout it replaced. Those two shapes are pinned
below as regression tests.

def test_the_cap_admits_every_real_command():
    """A cap that fires on real work would be worse than the bug it fixes.

    (This was named "…by_a_wide_margin" while asserting only `longest_real < cap`,
    i.e. any margin down to one character. The name promised what the assertion did
    not check — so the name came down to what is actually enforced rather than the
    assertion being tightened, because a wide margin is NOT wanted here: the cost
    ceiling is the binding constraint and the headroom is deliberately 1.13x.)

    Over 45,956 distinct real Bash commands from this install's history the longest is
    43,480 chars, so the cap is 1.13x that and fires on 0 of them — 1.20x against the
    40,925 a later, method-recorded re-derivation found. Deliberately not labelled
    MEASURED: see the provenance note on `_REAL_MAX_LEN` for why one of those two
    numbers cannot be re-checked, and why this file keeps the larger one anyway.

    THE FIGURE IN THIS TEST WAS ONCE 14,682, AND THAT IS THE POINT OF THE COMMENT.
    It came from an earlier corpus of 20,514 commands and justified a 32,768 cap as
    "2.2x headroom, 0 fires". The full corpus is 2.2x larger and holds three commands
    ABOVE that cap — all `cat > … <<EOF` here-docs writing review prose, a shape this
    workflow itself generates and the earlier corpus had not yet accumulated. A cap is
    only as good as the corpus it was sized against, and a corpus keeps growing after
    the measurement. Re-derive this number before trusting it; do not raise the cap to
    chase a single outlier without re-running the cost curve.

    The headroom is deliberately modest, because the cost ceiling binds before the
    corpus does. The cap trades against the hook's 5s budget, and the two directions
    are NOT symmetric: over the cap fails CLOSED (a refusal or a prompt), over the
    timeout fails OPEN (the command runs unchecked). Margin is bought on the
    failing-open side and paid for on the failing-closed side.

    Do NOT quote a depth-0 cost figure here to argue the cap is cheap. An earlier
    version of this docstring cited "0.86s at 64 KiB", which is the DEPTH-0 number —
    the same figure `shell_parse` explicitly labels as the mistake that produced an
    over-budget cap. Cost is length x levels; see the grid in `MAX_COMMAND_CHARS`.
