"""A guard whose module-scope import fails must still fail CLOSED.

THE DEFECT THIS LOCKS. ``run_guard`` is called at the BOTTOM of a guard, so an
exception raised while the module is still importing never reaches it. Python exits
1, and Claude Code's PreToolUse contract is "exit 2 blocks; ANY other code is a
non-blocking error, so the tool RUNS". MEASURED before the fix, across every guard
wired here: poison one shared sibling and each went exit 2 -> exit 1, with a
healthy-tree control still blocking at 2. The gate did not degrade — it VANISHED,
silently, while the session still believed it was protected. Version skew between a
worktree and the main tree makes this a real configuration here, not a hypothetical.

THE POPULATION IS ENUMERATED, NOT ASSERTED. An earlier revision of this module said
"all four guards that import ``shell_parse`` at module scope" — and an AST walk found
five more, three of them blocking. That claim now lives in
``test_every_module_scope_shell_parse_importer_is_accounted_for``, which derives the
set from the source and fails on an importer nobody has accounted for, so a new guard
added next year is a failing test rather than a silent hole.

WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS ARE TESTED, and why the benign arm is not padding: a degraded
guard that refused EVERYTHING would satisfy the blocking arm perfectly while wedging
the session. The pair is what makes either half meaningful, and the ``GUARD DEGRADED``
notice is asserted throughout because an operator who cannot tell a degraded allow
from a real one has been told nothing.

These drive the REAL guards as subprocesses against a tree with exactly one poisoned
sibling — not a mocked import — because the property is about what the interpreter
does at module load, which no in-process fake reproduces.

# ── Every hook that can fire on Bash must DECLARE its degrade direction ────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it is an allowlist rather than a count.
#
# The doctrine used to carry a hand-written figure ("six guards", then "9 of 13")
# for how much of the Bash surface refuses when `hook_input` is unimportable. That
# number was wrong three times running, and then went stale a fourth time WITHOUT
# anyone being wrong: another PR wired one more hook on matcher `Bash`, and a
# denominator written in prose cannot notice that. A number maintained by hand in
# four places is not a measurement, it is four chances to be out of date.
#
# So the number is no longer written down. It is DERIVED here, on every run, from
# `.claude/settings.json` — parsed, never grepped — and what is asserted is the
# RULE the number was only ever evidence for.
#
# THE RULE, derived by execution rather than assumed. The first hypothesis, "a hook
# that imports hook_input blocks", was REFUTED: every hook that can fire on Bash
# imports it at module scope, including every non-blocker. The real split is whether
# the module carries a degraded HANDLER:
#
#   A hook that can fire on Bash either
#     (a) carries a degraded handler, emits `GUARD DEGRADED` and exits 2, or
#     (b) is NAMED below - in _ADVISORY_BY_DESIGN with the words from its own
#         docstring, or in _NOT_PYTHON_ON_BASH because it never imports the module.
#
# Category (b) is a SILENT FAIL-OPEN: Claude Code treats a non-2 exit as a
# non-blocking error WHEN THE HOOK EMITS NO `permissionDecision`, so a guard that
# dies on its import traceback exits 1 and the tool call proceeds. That is correct
# for a hook whose contract is advisory, and a latent hole for anything else.
#
# THE POPULATION FILTER IS WHERE THE FAIL-OPEN LIVES, so it gets the care the
# assertion gets. An earlier version of this gate compared `matcher != "Bash"` —
# an exact-string test against a field Claude Code treats as a REGEX. Measured
# against mutated copies of the real settings, that version could not see a hook
# wired `"Bash|Edit"` or `".*"`, and silently DROPPED an existing blocker respelled
# as a bare `python3 .../guard.py`, leaving the suite green with one fewer guard
# under test. `procedure_advisor.py` is wired on `".*"` in this very repo, so that
# was not a hypothetical future gap — it was a live one.
#
# Two consequences, both deliberate: the matcher is evaluated as a regex, and a
# command that cannot be resolved to a script is a FAILING row rather than a
# skipped one. An unparseable hook is exactly what an allowlist must not wave
# through (the same rule, and the same resolver shape, as
# tests/test_scripts/test_hook_output_contract.py::_resolve).
#
# Deliberately NOT keyed on a docstring keyword scan: that was tried and it
# over-matches — "advisory" also appears in git_discard_guard, git_push_guard and
# repo_routing_guard, all of which DO refuse. An automatic oracle that misclassifies
# three of nine is worse than an explicit list someone had to think about. The
# quotes below are verified VERBATIM against each docstring by a test, so the
# justification cannot drift into invention.

#: Hooks that can fire on Bash but are not Python-via-launcher, so they never
#: import `hook_input` and cannot degrade with it. EXEMPT BY NAME, never invisible.
#:
#: Keyed on the EXACT normalised command, not a substring. A substring key is an
#: exemption with a wildcard on the end: a newly wired
#: `python3 scripts/cc-deploy-timeout-guard.py` would inherit the shell hook's
#: waiver and never be executed, which is precisely the "a new guard fails by
#: construction" guarantee this gate exists to make.
_NOT_PYTHON_ON_BASH = {
    "bash ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/cc-deploy-timeout-guard":
        "shell script; never imports hook_input",
}

#: The inline `bash -c` guard is exempted by its own exact text, which is long and
#: contains quoting, so it is matched after whitespace normalisation rather than
#: pasted here in full. The PREFIX is still an exact command opening, not a
#: substring that could appear anywhere in someone else's command.
_INLINE_SHELL_PREFIX = "bash -c 'IN=$(cat);"

#: Hooks that legitimately do NOT block when degraded.
#:
#: THIS IS A HUMAN CLAIM, like every other exemption list in this repo
#: (`_NOT_WIRED` above, `_STRUCTURALLY_BOUNDED` and `hook-output-exempt:` in
#: test_hook_output_contract.py, `UNMAPPED_BY_DESIGN` in the sentinel). The quote
#: is EVIDENCE OF INTENT — it must appear verbatim in the hook's own docstring,
#: which is checked, and which caught three invented justifications — but it is
#: not a proof of behaviour and is not presented as one.
#:
#: An earlier version tried to VERIFY the claim by scanning for blocking syntax.
#: It could not converge: a docstring keyword matched three hooks that DO refuse;
#: a verbatim quote passes on historical prose; an AST scan for `exit(2)` missed
#: `return 2`, the house spelling; a scan for `return 2` misses `BLOCK = 2`, a
#: computed status, or a delegated helper. A contract cannot be inferred from
#: syntax, and every refactor invents a spelling the scan does not know. The
#: right shape is an explicit declaration the hook entrypoint ENFORCES, which is
#: a change to the hooks rather than to this test — see the issue linked from the
#: PR. Until then this list is what it has always been: a claim someone had to
#: write down, next to the words that justify it.
