"""Tests for worktree_cwd_guard.py — cross-session worktree protection.

Tests the enhanced guard hook that:
1. Blocks removal if another process has CWD inside the target worktree
2. Blocks removal if the current session's CWD is the target (self-brick)
3. Blocks ALL direct worktree removal (redirects to lifecycle manager)
4. Handles ExitWorktree tool (--exit-worktree mode)
5. Hard-blocks EnterWorktree relocation (--enter-worktree mode)

Exit codes: 0 = allowed, 2 = blocked.

# The predicate was `\bgit\s+worktree\s+remove\b` over the raw command, and the
# target was then read by splitting the text that FOLLOWED the match. That is
# quote-blind: the phrase inside a grep pattern, a heredoc body or a commit
# message matched, and the next word became the "target", so a read-only search
# was refused with "use the lifecycle manager". It also MISSED real removals,
# because the regex required `git` immediately followed by `worktree` —
# `git -C <path> worktree remove <target>` slipped straight through.
#
# Observed over 51,052 (command, directory) pairs from this install's
# transcripts, each replayed from the directory it was typed in: 154 blocked
# before and 154 after — a DIFFERENT set, freeing 6 mention-only refusals and
# catching 6 real removals the old predicate allowed. Those transcripts hold
# real commands and cannot be published, so this is the scale at which the swap
# was observed on one install, not a result another reader can re-derive.
#
# An earlier draft of this comment said "48,363 … frees 4 … 150 -> 152". That
# was a superseded corpus (before the harness replayed each command from its own
# directory) and a superseded predicate (before the carrier fallback below). Two
# other files quoted two other versions of the same claim. One measurement, one
# set of numbers, or none.
