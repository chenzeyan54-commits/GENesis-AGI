"""Shared tokenizability probe, and the commit gate's fail-closed wrapper.

`shell_parse.analyze()` degrades to a naive split on a shlex error SILENTLY, so
it cannot report that its own answer is untrustworthy: "no gated segment found"
and "no gated command present" are the same return value. `untokenizable()` is
the signal that separates them, so a security-critical caller can pick its own
fail direction while the parser keeps degrading gracefully.

This file covers the probe itself, the removal of the duplicate copy of it in
`protected_paths_guard` (including that the guard actually CALLS the shared
one), and the commit gate's `run_guard` wrapper plus its degrade when
`review_state` will not load.

Trigger literals are assembled from fragments so this file's own text does not
carry them (matching the convention in test_shell_parse.py).
