"""End-to-end characterization corpus for ``git_push_guard.main()``'s pr-merge arm.

This is the *safety net* slice of the review-gate-core extraction. The extraction
will move the tangled fetch/decide/aggregate logic in ``main()`` behind a
``PrFacts`` snapshot + pure decision functions + one ``UNKNOWN -> BLOCK``
aggregator. That refactor must be **behaviour-preserving**, and this module is the
oracle that proves it: it drives the WHOLE merge arm end-to-end through ``main()``
and locks, per gate, the decision (block = exit 2 / allow = exit 0) *and* the
ordering between gates.

Why a NEW module rather than more helper tests: the decision *helpers*
(``_check_mergeable``, ``_check_codex_reviewed_head``, ``_check_pr_review_findings``
, ...) are already unit-locked in ``test_merge_review_gate.py`` /
``test_git_push_guard_codex_freshness.py``. What is NOT locked anywhere is
``main()``'s **aggregation** — the gate ORDERING (freshness before findings), the
``UNKNOWN -> BLOCK`` boundary at each gate, and the INDEPENDENCE of the override
sigils (``# ci-override`` / ``# stale-review-override`` / ``# review-override`` must
each waive only their own gate) — which is exactly what the extraction restructures.

Network-free by construction. Two injection mechanisms are combined, mirroring the
real code's (fragmented) fetch surface — itself the motivation for the extraction:
  * the granular ``_TEST_GH_*`` env seams for the gates that have them
    (head sha / codex reviews / CI rollup / base ref / default branch);
  * an in-process ``subprocess.run`` router for the three gates that have NO seam
    and shell out to gh directly (mergeable, review-body comments, inline comments).
