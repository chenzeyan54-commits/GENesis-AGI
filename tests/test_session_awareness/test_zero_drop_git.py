"""The git atoms are parsed against REAL git output, never a hand-made fixture.

Hand-rolled parsing of a tool's output is this repo's most reliably-wrong
pattern: a fixture written from memory encodes the shape you BELIEVE git emits,
so the test and the bug agree with each other. These tests drive a real
temporary repository through the real ``git`` binary, including the shapes that
break naive parsers — a path with a space, a non-ASCII path, a rename with its
origin field, and an untracked file.

The porcelain default output C-QUOTES any path with a space, a quote or a
non-ASCII byte; ``-z`` emits it raw. That is why the atom uses ``-z``, and this
file is what proves the difference matters.

    directory, which is UNREACHABLE, not necessarily gone. An unmounted volume

    `gitdir file points to non-existent location`, and DEMONSTRATED on git 2.43
