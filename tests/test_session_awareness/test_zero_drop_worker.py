"""A degraded sweep must FREEZE its classes — never half-apply.

This is the detector's single most dangerous failure mode and the reason it
exists at all. If a leg fails (git errors, the PR history caps) and the worker
reconciles anyway, every branch it could not look at is marked RESOLVED. The
board then reads CLEAN, and "what fell through the cracks?" is answered zero —
confidently, and wrongly. A partial sweep must leave the store untouched for
the classes it could not complete, and must not advance recurrence either: a
degraded run is not a counted run.

The legs are independent on purpose, so a gh outage cannot blind the worktree
class and a broken worktree cannot blind the branch classes.

    `prunable` means git could not find the worktree's directory. The code read
    that as "the directory is gone, so it holds no uncommitted work" — true of
    DELETION, false of UNREACHABILITY. An unmounted network or removable volume,
    or a directory renamed aside, produces the byte-identical
    `prunable gitdir file points to non-existent location`; DEMONSTRATED on git
    2.43 by moving a worktree directory away and back, with its uncommitted file
    intact throughout.

    Resolved, the finding's acknowledgement and recurrence count are destroyed
    permanently even though the work returns with the mount. The asymmetry is
    what settles it: a worktree whose `status` call FAILS is already held, and
    that is the same condition through a different door.
