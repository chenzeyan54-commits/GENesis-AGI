"""A "missing argument" error must not hide a malformed call.

When a long free-text argument is emitted with a closing tag that does not match
its opening tag, every parameter declared AFTER it is absorbed into that string.
The server then reports those parameters as *missing*, which reads like the
caller forgot them or like a tool bug. Measured on this install: six consecutive
identical refusals of one `follow_up_create` call before the shape was
diagnosed, with the evidence sitting in the error's own `input_value` throughout.

Two layers are exercised: the pure diagnosis, and the middleware wiring that
actually delivers it to a client through the real FastMCP pipeline. The second
matters because a diagnosis nothing raises is a diagnosis nobody reads.
