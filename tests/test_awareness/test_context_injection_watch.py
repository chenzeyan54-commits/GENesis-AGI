"""The ground-truth watcher over the harness's own filings.

A fresh ``hook-*-stdout.txt`` IS the harness saying "I withheld a hook's output
from the model". The watcher reads that rather than any emitter's arithmetic,
which is what keeps it correct when a CC update moves the cap under us — the
event that started this whole line of work.

These tests pin the properties that make it trustworthy: it never reports clean
when it could not look; it never lets a backlog of old files crowd out a fresh
incident; it never pages about another project's software; and it never drops a
filing it cannot attribute.
