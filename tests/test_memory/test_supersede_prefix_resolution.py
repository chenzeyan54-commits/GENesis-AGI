"""memory_store(supersedes=...) must resolve the short handles the ecosystem hands out.

The proactive recall hook prints memories as ``id:<8-char-prefix>`` and
``memory_expand`` resolves those handles on the READ side
(``mcp/memory/core.py::_resolve_id_prefixes``, whose docstring says the handles
"must resolve here"). The WRITE side never got the same treatment: ``supersedes``
went to an exact-match UPDATE that matched nothing, ``mark_superseded``'s
"did I find it" return value was discarded, and the only artifact of the whole
operation was a dangling ``succeeded_by`` edge whose source is not a memory.

MEASURED on the live DB 2026-09-06: three such rows created in a 14-minute
window (0 historically); one of the three targets is still ``deprecated=0``,
i.e. a memory that a session believed it had corrected is still live in recall.
Every one of the three handles resolved to exactly one memory, so resolution
alone would have prevented all three.

Real SQLite here, not mocks — the defect IS which rows the SQL matches, and a
mocked connection would happily confirm whatever the test asserted.
