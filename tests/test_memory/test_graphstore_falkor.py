"""FalkorGraphStore — contract, degradation, and the lever that selects it.

These are the behaviours a second GraphStore must not get wrong: that
unreachable raises rather than answering empty, that the facade degrades in the
right order, and that the lever stays on networkx until someone moves it.

Two tiers, and the split is deliberate. Most tests here are CONTRACT tests that
stub the client, so they run anywhere. But contract tests alone proved
insufficient: a mutation sweep found five ways to break the traversal's
semantics that every one of them survived — reading the FIRST hop's label
instead of the last, inverting best-parent-wins, reversing every projected edge,
marking the whole projection deprecated, dropping the result ordering. All five
are invisible to a test that asserts on a query STRING, so the second tier
executes real Cypher against a live engine (`engine_gated`), and that is the
tier that kills them.

Engine-gated tests are SKIPPED where the engine is not armed — CI has no engine,
so they are not a substitute for the contract tier, they are a supplement to it.
They write only `test_`-prefixed graph keys and delete them in a `finally`; they
must never touch the canonical `genesis_memory` projection.

RUNNING THE ENGINE-GATED TIER, because a plain invocation will NOT run it:

    pytest tests/test_memory/test_graphstore_falkor.py --noconftest -q \\
        -o asyncio_mode=auto

`--noconftest` is required from an environment that has the `falkordb` client but
not Genesis's full dependency tree (the repo conftest imports the world). Two
consequences worth knowing rather than discovering:

* It escapes the repo's test lock (`genesis/util/pytest_lock.py` says so
  explicitly) and every autouse safety fixture. These tests are safe under that
  because they build their own tmp SQLite and touch only `test_`-prefixed graph
  keys — contained by their own discipline, not by the harness. Do not add a
  test here that writes anywhere else without re-checking that.
* Two sessions running this tier at once contend on the SHARED live engine,
  which no test lock covers. The staging keys are pid-suffixed so projections
  cannot corrupt each other, but the `test_`-prefixed graphs are not.

Without the flag the tier reports three SKIPs, which looks identical to passing
in a summary line — and the five semantic mutations it exists to kill quietly
come back into range.
