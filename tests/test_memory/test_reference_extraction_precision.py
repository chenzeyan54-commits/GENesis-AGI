"""Precision regression tests for the reference classifier.

The 2h ``memory_extraction`` job runs ``classify_as_reference`` over
LLM-generated extraction prose. Before this fix it mis-classified ordinary
conversation/analysis as references, fabricating credential/network values:

- credential patterns matched a bare label word + space + the next word, so
  prose like "can pin checkpoints" / "content pass committed" produced a
  credential with value "checkpoints" / "committed".
- the network gate checked for a context word ANYWHERE in the content (and by
  substring), so an incidental IP plus a far-away "container" / "IP" inside
  "IPs" produced a network reference.

These tests pin the exact junk that was found in the live store, plus a
pair-prose class case, and guard that genuine references still classify.
