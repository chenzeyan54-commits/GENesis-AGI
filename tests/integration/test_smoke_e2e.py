"""Smoke tests requiring real services or long runtime.

Marked ``@pytest.mark.slow`` — which currently selects nothing. This docstring
used to claim these were "skipped in normal CI runs"; they are not. CI passes
no ``-m "not slow"`` (see the `test` job in .github/workflows/ci.yml) and the
marker is not registered in pyproject's ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]``, so it is
an inert label and these tests run with every other. The mark is kept because
``pytest -v -m slow tests/integration/test_smoke_e2e.py`` still selects them
locally, and because deselecting them in CI would be a coverage decision, not a
docstring fix.
